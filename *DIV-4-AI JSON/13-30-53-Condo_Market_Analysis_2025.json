Compare findings to April 2022 when I bought the property at $400,000. For context, 4C and 4D are one condominium after construction merged the properties over a decade ago.  The condo is located in the Commons of New St. in Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia, pa. The condo also comes with two parking spots as a result of previously being two deeds, two 1 BR/1Bathroom condos now merged to a 2 BR / 2 Bathroom condo. Factor in condo HOA fees of $351.08 (4C) and $461.75 (4D) and interest rates currently vs. interest rates when I bought the condo which I have a 4.25% interest rates. The principal at time of purchase in April 2022 was $360,000 as I put down 10% at the amount of $40,000 and closing costs were $23,500 at the time of closing in Philadelphia. I’m trying to sell the condominium currently. The realtor I work with initially priced the condominium at $465,000 in August 2024. It is now February 18th, 2025 and the condo has not sold. The realtor has reduced the price multiple times. Her strategy has consisted of multiple $1,000 reductions. She claims this resurfaces the MLS listing and in the two times she has convinced me to reduce by $1,000 we have see the smallest of flurry of interest in the form of showings, but no offers. She has also listed the property for rent. During a 12 month period from October 1st, 2023 - September 30th, 2024, there were renters in the unit as I lived in Florida for work. They paid $2,800/month and that included the two parking spots. The condo was tenant filled and was losing money and would again if rented at the same amount. PECO is roughly $150 per month. Water and basic utilities are paid through the HOA. However, the condo has been vacant entirely since October 1st, 2024. The principal balance of the load is $342,670.30 at 4.25% interest rates with a 5/1/2052 maturity date. The monthly mortgage amount is $2,494.13 and this includes $555.39 principal payment, $1,215.59 interest payment, and $723.15 escrow payment resulting in the final total each month of $2,494.13. The parking lot is garage door and fence on one side and surrounded by buildings on three walls, with the back wall being a brand new apartment building. The address of the parking lot is 213 New St. Philadelphia, PA 19106 and of the 22 spots, I have two. The rate of construction in the immediate vicinity is very high and I wonder if the parking lot could ever sell, but the HOA would have to be unanimous on the vote I’m told and parking in old city is very difficult. Right now, I’m renting one parking spot for $250.00 per month. Ultimately, I want to know if the property in April 2022 when i purchased at $400,000 was priced to the comparable the same way the $433,000 2025 live sale price is and how the current price is justified as correct or too low, or too high based on comparable. Also, i want to know if the parking lot is worth holding onto the condo"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"91401745f8327fbe-IAD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"87ed54c8-4413-45e4-a05f-8159388103fc","children":["7cba53ab-ba02-465f-9b30-a4982af80780"]},"7cba53ab-ba02-465f-9b30-a4982af80780":{"id":"7cba53ab-ba02-465f-9b30-a4982af80780","message":{"id":"7cba53ab-ba02-465f-9b30-a4982af80780","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739903565.213261,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"model_editable_context","model_set_context":"","repository":null,"repo_summary":null,"structured_context":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"f74728a5-571b-42b7-9d7f-db6397b3c7cc","request_id":"91401745f8327fbe-IAD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"f74728a5-571b-42b7-9d7f-db6397b3c7cc","children":["2f101f54-8aa6-4bd4-974c-a2da6d40189d"]},"2f101f54-8aa6-4bd4-974c-a2da6d40189d":{"id":"2f101f54-8aa6-4bd4-974c-a2da6d40189d","message":{"id":"2f101f54-8aa6-4bd4-974c-a2da6d40189d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1739903565.213516,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["### **Refined Deep Research Prompt for Condo Analysis**\n\n#### **Objective:**\nProvide the most comprehensive analysis of **246 N 3rd St. #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106**, assessing its **current for-sale price of $433,000 (as of February 2025)** in comparison to:\n1. **Comparable sold units** and **active for-sale condo listings** in a **fairly selected comparison region** that best represents market trends.\n2. **The market conditions in April 2022**, when the property was purchased for **$400,000**, to determine if the original purchase price was aligned with fair market value at the time and how it compares to the current pricing.\n\n#### **Background Details on the Property:**\n- **Location & Building:** Commons of New St. in Old City, Philadelphia.\n- **Unit History:** Originally two 1BR/1BA condos (4C and 4D), merged over a decade ago into a **2BR/2BA condo**.\n- **Parking:** Includes **two parking spaces** at 213 New St., part of a **22-spot parking lot** with secure access.\n- **HOA Fees:**  \n  - 4C: **$351.08**  \n  - 4D: **$461.75**  \n- **Utility Costs:**  \n  - PECO: **~$150/month**  \n  - Water & Basic Utilities: **Covered by HOA**  \n- **Interest Rate at Purchase:** **4.25% fixed**  \n- **Mortgage Details:**  \n  - Principal at purchase (April 2022): **$360,000** (10% down payment of **$40,000**)  \n  - **Current principal balance (February 2025): $342,670.30**  \n  - **Monthly mortgage payment:** $2,494.13, broken down as:  \n    - Principal: **$555.39**  \n    - Interest: **$1,215.59**  \n    - Escrow: **$723.15**  \n- **Closing Costs (April 2022):** **$23,500**  \n- **Rental History:**  \n  - **Leased at $2,800/month** (Oct 1, 2023 – Sept 30, 2024), including two parking spots.  \n  - The rental **operated at a loss** and would again if leased at the same rate.  \n  - **Vacant since October 1, 2024**.  \n- **Parking Rental Income:** Currently renting one space for **$250/month**.  \n- **Local Development Impact:** **High construction activity in the area**.
