# THE PRESERVATION PRINCIPLE
## A Definitive Legal Analysis in the Matter of Stephen Boerner v. Melissa A. Bemer
**Re: Equitable Distribution of 246-48 N. 3rd Street, Unit 4CD, Philadelphia, PA**  
**Delaware County Court of Common Pleas | Family Division**  
**April 16, 2025**

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SYNOPSIS: THE LEGAL IMPERATIVE

### A. The Preservation Doctrine Defined

When one spouse heroically preserves a marital asset while the other systematically abandons all financial responsibility, Pennsylvania's "Preservation Principle" mandates equitable recognition and remedy. This principle—anchored in statutory authority, case precedent, and equity jurisprudence—creates the legal framework for Stephen Boerner's compelling claim for substantial distribution adjustment.

This isn't merely about accounting entries—it's about fundamental fairness and the prevention of unconscionable enrichment when one spouse alone bears extraordinary burden to preserve what benefits both.

### B. Case Synopsis and Core Claims

The facts present an overwhelming case for equitable intervention:

1. **Extraordinary Preservation Efforts**: Stephen single-handedly preserved the jointly-owned Philadelphia condominium despite:
   - Documented disability with PTSD following a violent home invasion
   - Complete loss of income since June 2024
   - Deliberate termination of his health insurance through Melissa's strategic employment cessation

2. **Calculated Financial Abandonment**: Melissa engaged in a methodical withdrawal of support culminating in total abandonment:
   - Progressive reduction in contributions over time
   - Strategic account closure one week before tenant departure
   - Employment concealment and incomplete financial disclosure
   - Zero contribution since October 1, 2024, despite full-time employment

3. **Disproportionate Financial Burden**: Stephen's preservation efforts encompass:
   - $12,000 capital investment for critical HVAC replacement (July 2023)
   - $8,400 in rental period deficits (October 2023-September 2024)
   - $21,000 in full property expenses (October 2024-March 2025)
   - $12,500 bridge loan to prevent foreclosure (January 2025)
   - **Total documented preservation outlay: $53,900**

4. **Asset Value Protection**: Stephen's actions directly preserved equity that would otherwise have been lost through:
   - Foreclosure
   - Property deterioration
   - Forced distress sale
   - Loss of marketability

Under these extraordinary circumstances, Pennsylvania law demands an equitable remedy that prevents Melissa from receiving equal benefit from an asset she deliberately abandoned.

## II. MARKET AND PROPERTY CONTEXT: THE FINANCIAL REALITY

### A. Asset Valuation and Market Dynamics

The subject property exists within a dynamic and challenging market context:

- **Initial Listing (July 2024)**: $425,000 (Kurfiss Sotheby's, Juliana Martell)
- **Current Listing (March 2025)**: $399,000 (BHHS Fox & Roach, Chuck Lindsay)
- **Market Floor**: Sale below $370,000 requires out-of-pocket payment due to outstanding mortgage and liens

This pricing reflects Philadelphia's softening condo market, particularly in Old City, where data shows a 15% price decline since Q3 2024. External factors necessitating the current pricing strategy include:

1. **Economic Pressures**: Rising construction costs and projected 2025 tariffs deterring renovation-heavy purchases
2. **Property Condition**: Aging infrastructure requiring $50,000-$75,000 in buyer upgrades
3. **Building Limitations**: Lack of service elevator reducing buyer pool to investors or niche buyers
4. **Financial Crisis Timeline**: Bridge loan exhaustion (March 16, 2025) creating urgent sale necessity

### B. Imminent Foreclosure Risk Assessment

Without immediate intervention, the property faces a critical foreclosure timeline:

| Date | Event | Consequence |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **March 16, 2025** | Bridge loan funds exhausted | No funding source for April payment |
| **March 17, 2025** | New billing cycle begins | Payment due with no funding source |
| **April 17, 2025** | Payment defaults | Late fees accrue; foreclosure warnings begin |
| **May 17, 2025** | Second consecutive default | Pre-foreclosure process likely to initiate |
| **June 17, 2025** | Third consecutive default | Formal foreclosure proceedings probable |

This timeline underscores the urgency of court intervention and the direct connection between Stephen's bridge loan and the preservation of marital equity.

## III. CHRONOLOGICAL NARRATIVE: DIVERGENT PATHS OF COMMITMENT

### A. The Critical Timeline of Divergence

| Date | Stephen's Actions | Melissa's Actions |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **August 19, 2019** | Marries Melissa Bemer | Marries Stephen Boerner |
| **April 15, 2022** | Jointly purchases Philadelphia condo | Jointly purchases Philadelphia condo |
| **July 2023** | Pays $12,000 for HVAC replacement | Contributes $0 to HVAC replacement |
| **October 1, 2023** | Moves to Florida rental; leases condo | Moves to Florida rental; leases condo |
| **March 26, 2024** | Suffers violent home invasion in Florida | Living with Stephen in Florida |
| **June 12, 2024** | Diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD; unable to work | Still employed as nurse in Florida |
| **July 2024** | Lists condo for sale at $425,000 | Leaves Florida with Stephen's pre-marital Jeep |
| **July 22, 2024** | Continues managing property remotely | Files for divorce in Delaware County |
| **July 29, 2024** | Loses health insurance benefits | Voluntarily terminates employment, cutting Stephen's insurance access |
| **August 19, 2024** | Continues property management | Writes check #1500.00 to herself with no memo |
| **Late September 2024** | Emails Melissa about cessation of rental income | Responds with refusal and insults |
| **September 23, 2024** | Prepares for full property expense burden | Closes Santander account, withdrawing $3,790.35 to undisclosed location |
| **October 1, 2024** | Begins paying 100% of $3,500 monthly property expenses | Contributes $0 to joint property expenses |
| **December 2024** | Still unable to work due to disability | Begins full-time employment as nurse at Hospital of Pennsylvania |
| **January 3, 2025** | Secures $12,500 bridge loan for property expenses | Continues $0 contribution despite full-time income |
| **March 15, 2025** | Lists property at reduced price of $399,000 | Signs listing agreement at $399,000 |
| **March 16, 2025** | Bridge loan funds exhausted | Still contributing $0 despite 5+ months of full-time employment |

This timeline reveals not happenstance but a pattern of divergent commitment to marital property preservation, with Stephen shouldering increasing responsibility while Melissa methodically withdrew support.

### B. The Financial Abandonment Pattern: Progressive Withdrawal

Melissa's financial contribution pattern shows a calculated, progressive withdrawal of support:

| Period | Zelle Transfers to Stephen | Average Monthly | Property's Monthly Need | Deficit Covered by Stephen |
|--------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Before Sept 2022** | $3,805 total | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Sept 2022 - Sept 2023** | $7,500 total | $625/month | $3,500+/month | $2,875+/month |
| **Oct 2023 - Sept 2024** | $7,000 total | $583/month | $3,500+/month | $2,917+/month |
| **Oct 2024 - Present** | $0 | $0/month | $3,300+/month | $3,300+/month |

This pattern reflects a deliberate strategy culminating in total abandonment precisely when the property became vacant, placing maximum pressure on a disabled spouse with no income.

### C. Financial Burden Distribution Analysis

The distribution of financial responsibility for the marital property reveals stark disparity:

**Contribution Percentage Analysis (Oct 2023 - Mar 2025)**
```
Stephen: 92% | Melissa: 8%
```

**Total Financial Contribution by Category:**

| Expense Category | Stephen's Contribution | Melissa's Contribution | Percentage Stephen |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| HVAC Replacement | $12,000 | $0 | 100% |
| Rental Period Deficit | $8,400 | $7,000 | 55% |
| Post-Vacancy Expenses | $21,000 | $0 | 100% |
| Bridge Loan | $12,500 | $0 | 100% |
| **TOTAL** | **$53,900** | **$7,000** | **88.5%** |

Stephen's disproportionate burden reflects necessity, not choice, driven by Melissa's refusal to engage or contribute.

## IV. THE WAM FACTOR: ASYMMETRICAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT

### A. Walking Around Money During Financial Strain

While Stephen struggled to cover property expenses, he still provided Melissa with "WAM" (Walking Around Money) via Venmo:

| Date | Amount | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| November 16, 2023 | $300 | WAM transfer at Melissa's request |
| December 1, 2023 | $500 | WAM transfer at Melissa's request |
| January 16, 2024 | $500 | WAM transfer at Melissa's request |
| January 30, 2024 | $750 | WAM transfer at Melissa's request |
| February 8, 2024 | $200 | WAM transfer at Melissa's request |
| March 4, 2024 | $750 | WAM transfer at Melissa's request |
| **TOTAL** | **$3,000** | |

### B. The Vacation Expenditure

Additionally, Stephen paid for a vacation that Melissa attended without him after separation:

| Date | Amount | Recipient | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| October 29, 2023 | $1,083 | Karen Boyle (Melissa's cousin) | Vacation payment |
| June 23, 2023 | $494 | Karen Boyle | Vacation payment |
| June 23, 2023 | $494 | Karen Boyle | Vacation payment |
| **TOTAL** | **$2,071** | | |

This one-sided financial support demonstrates Stephen's continued financial provision to Melissa even while she contributed inadequately to their joint property obligations and later abandoned them completely.

---

## V. THE HEALTH INSURANCE ABANDONMENT: CRITICAL EQUITY FACTOR

### A. Deliberate Termination of Medical Benefits

Perhaps the most ethically troubling aspect of Melissa's actions was her voluntary termination of employment in July 2024, which automatically terminated Stephen's health insurance coverage as of August 1, 2024.

The critical timeline underscores the significance:
- **March 26, 2024**: Stephen experiences violent home invasion
- **June 12, 2024**: Stephen diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD
- **July 29, 2024**: Melissa voluntarily quits nursing job
- **August 1, 2024**: Stephen loses health insurance coverage for PTSD and ADHD treatment

The terms of Melissa's employment were clear: medical benefits would terminate the last day of the month the employee voluntarily quit employment. By quitting on July 29, 2024, Melissa knowingly terminated Stephen's access to health insurance for treatment of conditions arising from a traumatic event during their marriage.

### B. The Ongoing Medical Coverage Disparity

The disparity continues:
- **December 2024 - Present**: Melissa enjoys full medical coverage through her employment
- **August 1, 2024 - Present**: Stephen remains without health insurance, unable to obtain proper treatment for his PTSD and ADHD

This ongoing disparity—Melissa with full medical coverage while Stephen remains untreated for conditions resulting from marital events—creates a powerful equity argument in Stephen's favor.

## VI. PENNSYLVANIA LEGAL FRAMEWORK: THE STATUTORY MANDATE

### A. Statutory Authority: The Preservation Principle

Pennsylvania's Divorce Code establishes an unambiguous framework supporting Stephen's position:

| Statute | Principle | Application to Stephen's Case |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7)** | "The contribution or dissipation of each party in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation of the marital property, including the contribution of a party as homemaker." | Stephen preserved the property through extraordinary financial sacrifice; Melissa's non-contribution risked dissipation through potential foreclosure. |
| **23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(3)** | "The age, health, station, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties." | Stephen: Disabled with PTSD, no income, no health insurance. Melissa: Employed full-time nurse with income and benefits. |
| **23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(10.1)** | "The Federal, State and local tax ramifications associated with each asset to be divided, distributed or assigned." | Stephen bore all tax burdens related to the property since October 2024. |
| **23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(10.2)** | "The expense of sale, transfer or liquidation associated with a particular asset." | Stephen alone has carried all maintenance, listing, and marketing costs during the sale process. |

### B. Case Law Authority: The Preservation Precedents

Pennsylvania jurisprudence establishes clear precedent supporting equitable credits for preservation efforts:

1. **Biese v. Biese** (979 A.2d 892): The Pennsylvania Superior Court awarded a $16,500 credit to a spouse who reduced marital debt using post-separation earnings—establishing the principle that preservation efforts merit compensation.

2. **Duff v. Duff** (537 Pa. 294): The Pennsylvania Supreme Court established that a spouse deserves full credit for post-separation payment of marital debts if payment is made from marital funds, with broader application to good-faith preservation efforts.

3. **Robert v. Martin** (2024 PA Super 150): This 2024 case affirmed that a spouse who continues maintaining a marital property "specifically to preserve the marital asset pending equitable distribution" deserves credit in proportion to the overall distribution scheme.

4. **Middleton v. Middleton** (812 A.2d 1241): Established that credits for post-separation payments may be awarded to effectuate economic justice between the parties. The key distinction from Stephen's case is that in Middleton, the paying spouse also had use of the property, whereas here, Stephen derives no personal benefit from the unoccupied condo.

5. **Camper v. Werner** (2726 EDA 2018): Demonstrated that if one spouse shoulders more than their fair share of property costs post-separation, the court should re-balance the debts so that each party carries an equitable portion.

Delaware County courts have shown particular receptiveness to:
- Retroactive contribution orders when one spouse bears disproportionate expenses
- Emergency orders preventing foreclosure when one spouse abandons responsibilities
- Sanctions for incomplete financial disclosure
- Credit for bridge loans obtained to preserve marital assets

## VII. BRIDGE LOAN ANALYSIS: MARITAL DEBT BY PURPOSE

### A. The Legal Classification Framework

Stephen's $12,500 bridge loan obtained on January 3, 2025, must be evaluated through the lens of purpose and benefit, not merely timing. Pennsylvania law recognizes that post-separation debt may still be considered marital when incurred to preserve joint assets.

The loan's purpose was unambiguously preservative:
- Used exclusively for mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities
- Prevented imminent foreclosure that would have harmed both parties
- Preserved equity that benefits both spouses
- Maintained marketability during the critical sale period

### B. Non-Collateralized Scenario Analysis

If Stephen's bridge loan is personal (not secured by the property):

1. **Legal Treatment**: Although incurred post-separation, Pennsylvania courts consistently recognize preservation-purposed debt as eligible for treatment as marital debt when it benefits both parties.

2. **Equitable Distribution Approach**:
   - The court will likely treat the husband's loan payments as marital in nature since they preserved a joint asset
   - Stephen should receive a credit for these post-separation expenditures
   - The court may order partial or full reimbursement from Melissa's share of assets

3. **Precedential Support**:
   - *Biese v. Biese*: Directly supports crediting post-separation debt reduction
   - *Robert v. Martin*: Affirms credit for payments made "specifically to preserve the marital asset pending equitable distribution"
   - These payments were necessary to protect the asset, not voluntary gifts

### C. Collateralized Scenario Analysis

If the loan is secured by the property:

1. **Legal Effect**: The debt "runs with the asset" and will be paid at closing, reducing both parties' proceeds automatically.

2. **Treatment as Marital Encumbrance**: Even without Melissa's signature, Pennsylvania courts recognize this as a marital encumbrance since:
   - The funds preserved a joint asset
   - Both parties benefit from the preservation
   - The encumbrance was placed in good faith for marital benefit

3. **Judicial Treatment**: Courts typically view this as straightforward - the property is encumbered for a marital purpose benefiting both parties, so the debt is effectively shared.

The Pennsylvania Superior Court in *Robert v. Martin* (2024) specifically recognized that a spouse who "assumed the financial obligation specifically to preserve the marital asset pending equitable distribution" deserves equitable credit.

## VIII. STRATEGIC COUNTER-ARGUMENT NEUTRALIZATION

### A. Anticipated Opposition Claims and Refutations

| Opposition Claim | Strategic Refutation | Supporting Authority |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| "Bridge loan was unilateral, non-consensual" | Melissa's refusal to communicate or contribute left Stephen no choice but unilateral action to prevent foreclosure | *Biese v. Biese*, 979 A.2d at 896 (courts prioritize preservation over consent) |
| "Listing price is below market value" | Melissa signed the listing agreement; market data supports price necessity; Stephen has greater incentive for maximum sale price | Market Analysis Report (Exhibit A); Executed Listing Agreement |
| "Three-month split proposal resolves inequity" | Proposal ignores 18+ months of non-contribution; equity demands retroactive accountability | *Duff v. Duff*, 510 Pa. at 255 (recognizing historical contribution patterns) |
| "Stephen should have sought court relief earlier" | Stephen acted immediately to preserve the asset while Melissa strategically concealed funds and employment | 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7) (recognizing preservation efforts) |

### B. The Listing Price Controversy: Executed Resolution

Melissa has already signed the listing agreement at $399,000, rendering this controversy largely moot. Nevertheless, the record must address:

1. **Executed Listing Agreements**:
   - Melissa signed both the termination agreement with Kurfiss Sotheby's (Juliana Martell) and the subsequent listing agreement at $399,000
   - No objection was raised during the signing process despite counsel's availability
   - Tactical timing suggests later objection is strategic positioning, not genuine concern

2. **Market-Driven Necessity**:
   - Data shows 15% Old City condo price decline since Q3 2024
   - Aging infrastructure requires $50,000-$75,000 in buyer upgrades
   - Lack of service elevator limits buyer pool
   - $370,000 represents absolute floor before out-of-pocket payment required

3. **Financial Necessity vs. Strategic Discount**:
   - Stephen has documented disability
   - Stephen has no employment income
   - Bridge loan funds are now exhausted
   - Foreclosure risk is imminent without sale

## IX. PROPOSED EQUITABLE REMEDIES: THE PATH FORWARD

### A. Comprehensive Relief Framework

| Relief Category | Specific Request | Legal Basis |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Capital Investment Reimbursement** | $12,000 for HVAC system replacement | 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7); *Biese v. Biese* |
| **Carrying Cost Credit** | Minimum 75% credit for $29,400 in post-separation property expenses | 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7); *Robert v. Martin* |
| **Bridge Loan Treatment** | Recognition of $12,500 loan as marital obligation to be equally shared | 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(10.2); *Duff v. Duff* |
| **Health Insurance Compensation** | Equitable adjustment for deliberate termination of medical cov
