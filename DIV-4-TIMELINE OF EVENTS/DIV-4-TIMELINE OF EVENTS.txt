Under Delaware County precedent and Pennsylvania family law statutes, these actions constitute sanctionable conduct warranting pursuit of maximum alimony award, equitable property distribution favoring client, and potential monetary sanctions for disclosure violations. The immediate filing of emergency motions for interim relief and comprehensive disclosure is recommended to preserve client's financial position and prevent further deterioration of marital assets.",
