## IV. LEGAL DOCTRINES & PRINCIPLES

### A. VERIFIED (Include in Legal Communications)
- Spousal Fiduciary Duty - derived from § 3501(a)'s preservation requirement, not from *Butler v. Butler*
  * § 3501(a) obligates spouses to preserve marital assets during separation
  * Courts interpret this as imposing a duty to act in the marital estate's best interests
  * *Mohen v. Mohen* (2021) and *Nagle v. Nagle* support this interpretation
- Good Faith Requirement - derived from § 3502(a)'s equitable distribution factors, not from *Schenk v. Schenk*
  * § 3502(a) mandates equitable division based on factors including contributions and economic circumstances
  * Courts interpret this as requiring good faith in asset management
- Asset Preservation Credit - informal practice supported by *Duff v. Duff*
  * Courts apply this under § 3502(a)(4) (preservation efforts)
  * Case-specific, not universally binding
- Professional Services as Contribution - § 3502(a)(7) recognizes non-economic contributions
  * May include professional support, homemaking, etc.
  * Statutory basis, not derived from *Verholek*

  * Mandates spousal support based on financial ability
  * Reinforced by *Marshall v. Marshall*
- Asset Dissipation - § 3502(a)(7) and *Hicks v. Kubit*
  * Use "dissipation" for wasteful spending, not "manipulation"
  * Courts penalize wasteful spending as breach of good faith
- Marital Debt Classification - *Hicks v. Kubit* for debt classification principles
  * Classifies student loans as marital debt but assigns to beneficiary spouse
  * Preservation expenses fall under § 3502(a)(4), not *Hicks*
- Financial Discovery Violation - Pa.R.C.P. 1920.33
  * Mandates financial disclosures
  * Non-compliance risks sanctions (e.g., barred evidence)

### C. DO NOT INCLUDE IN ANY WRITING TO BE USED IN THIS CASE. THIS LIST IS OFF LIMITS FROM USE:

- Remove Johnston v. Johnston citation.
- Remove Commonwealth v. Brewer (2005): A criminal case about burden of proof, unrelated to family law
- Remove explicit mention of "Financial Abandonment Doctrine" as a formal doctrine, but keep the analysis of the pattern of financial abandonment under § 3502(a)(7).
- Remove "Vanishing Credit Doctrine" if it was present (it was reframed in prior drafts, but double-check).ate
- Direct quotes from HOA meeting notes
- Remove Larkin v. Larkin, 750 A.2d 895 (Pa. Super. 2000) - No Pennsylvania case matches this citation. 
- A 1978 case (396 A.2d 761) addresses spousal support, not FMLA The search results include a Larkin v. Larkin case, but from 1978 (396 A.2d 761), not 2000. This 1978 case involved a wife’s petition for support, not FMLA or reasonable accommodation issues. There is no evidence in the search results of a 2000 Larkin case establishing any doctrine about FMLA accommodation.
- In re: Marriage of Donnelly, 837 A.2d 1247 (Pa. Super. 2003) Finding: This case citation appears to be fabricated.
The search results include a Donnelly case (Donnelly v. Richner), but it’s a 2017 New Jersey bankruptcy case, not a 2003 Pennsylvania Superior Court case. It does not establish anything about “willful medical abandonment.”
- Commonwealth v. Brewer, 876 A.2d 1029 (Pa. 2005) - Finding: This case exists but is misrepresented. While this case citation is accurate, the case establishes a standard about the Commonwealth not needing to establish guilt to a mathematical certainty in criminal proceedings. It has nothing to do with FMLA, medical support options, or “exceptional hardship” in divorce contexts.
- Busse v. Busse, 921 A.2d 1248 (Pa. 2007) Finding: This case exists but is misrepresented.This case is cited accurately, but it pertains to reviewing an award of counsel fees for abuse of discretion, not establishing a “medical priority evidence” doctrine. The context in the search results shows it’s about sanctions for violating conduct provisions, not abandonment in relation to medical needs.
- Harrison v. Harrison, 894 A.2d 1157 (Pa. Super. 2006) Finding: This case citation appears to be fabricated. The search results contain no Harrison v. Harrison case from Pennsylvania in 2006. While volume 894 of Atlantic Reporter 2d is referenced, this specific case is not present in the provided search results.
