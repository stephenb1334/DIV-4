## VI. CONCLUSION: PRESERVATION CREDIT CALCULATION

Based on this evidence matrix, Plaintiff is entitled to substantial preservation credits under Pennsylvania equitable distribution law and the Financial Abandonment Doctrine:

1. **Minimum Preservation Credit: $46,900**
   * HVAC Capital Improvement: $12,000
   * Rental Period Deficit: $1,400
   * Post-Vacancy Carrying Costs: $21,000+
   * Bridge Loan Principal: $12,500

2. **Additional Compensable Damages**
   * Medical expenses resulting from insurance termination
   * Interest on bridge loan ($12,500)
   * Legal fees for emergency preservation motions

This evidence matrix demonstrates a clear and compelling pattern of financial abandonment by Defendant contrasted with extraordinary preservation efforts by Plaintiff, justifying significant equitable distribution adjustments under Pennsylvania law.
