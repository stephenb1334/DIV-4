- **Market Listing**: Initially listed at $465,000 in August 2024; now reduced to $433,000 due to lack of interest.

## **Market Context**
1. **Philadelphia Real Estate Trends**:
   - Median home prices in Philadelphia have shown moderate growth but remain below your asking price for Old City condos. As of late 2024, the median home price was approximately $257,000–$290,000 depending on the area[6][55].
   - The rental market remains strong but competitive, with average rents around $1,891/month[6].
2. **Old City Market Specifics**:
   - Condos in Old City are desirable but face challenges like high HOA fees and competition from single-family homes or newer developments[9][54].
   - Your HOA fee of $750/month is higher than the city average (~$449/month), which can deter buyers[7][12].

## **Challenges**
1. **High Monthly Costs**: The combined mortgage, escrow, and HOA fees significantly exceed potential rental income. Even at the current rental listing of $2,600/month, you face a monthly deficit of ~$644 before utilities.
2. **Limited Buyer Interest**:
   - The property has been on the market for six months with no offers.
   - High HOA fees and limited amenities compared to other buildings may reduce its appeal[9][16].
3. **Marketing Efforts**:
   - The realtor appears to be relying on minimal marketing efforts (e.g., open houses and small price adjustments) without leveraging advanced digital strategies or broader outreach.

## **Recommendations**
### **For Selling the Property**
1. **Reassess Pricing Strategy**:
   - Your current asking price of $433,000 may still be too high given market conditions and comparable properties in Old City[10][27]. Consider reducing it further to align with buyer expectations.
   - Highlight unique features like two parking spots in a gated lot—a valuable asset in Old City.

2. **Enhance Marketing Efforts**:
   - Invest in professional photography and virtual tours to attract remote buyers or investors[46][57].
   - Use targeted digital advertising to reach potential buyers outside the immediate area (e.g., suburban buyers looking for city properties)[58].
   - Emphasize the potential rental income and parking spots as selling points for investors.

3. **Address Buyer Concerns About HOA Fees**:
   - Provide detailed documentation about what the HOA fee covers (e.g., maintenance, insurance) to justify the cost.
   - If possible, negotiate with the HOA board to consider reducing fees or offering incentives for new buyers.

### **For Renting the Property**
If selling proves unfeasible in the short term:
1. **Lower Rent Temporarily**: Reduce the rental price slightly below market value (e.g., $2,500/month) to attract tenants quickly and minimize vacancy losses.
2. **Offer Incentives**: Consider including one month free or covering utilities like PECO to entice renters.
3. **Professional Property Management**: Hire a property manager who can market the unit effectively and handle tenant relations.

### **Divorce Considerations**
Since you and your wife are divorcing:
- Consult a financial advisor or mediator to determine how best to divide proceeds from a sale or rental income.
- If neither party wishes to retain ownership long-term, prioritize selling even if it means accepting a lower price.

### **Long-Term Options**
1. **Hold Until Market Improves**: If financially viable, consider holding onto the property until market conditions improve or interest rates drop.
2. **Refinance or Pay Down Principal**: Explore refinancing options to reduce monthly payments or make additional principal payments if possible.

## Conclusion
Selling at a competitive price while enhancing marketing efforts is likely your best option given your desire to divest ownership and minimize financial losses. If selling remains challenging, renting at a reduced rate can provide interim relief while you continue exploring sale opportunities.
