THE FINANCIAL ABANDONMENT DOCTRINE
A Comprehensive Legal Strategy for Stephen Boerner's Equitable Distribution Case in Delaware County, Pennsylvania
I. EXECUTIVE BRIEF: THE LEGAL FULCRUM
In Pennsylvania divorce proceedings, what happens when one spouse methodically abandons all financial responsibility for a jointly-owned marital asset while the other makes extraordinary sacrifices to preserve it? Pennsylvania law provides a powerful remedial framework through what I call the "Financial Abandonment Doctrine" - a synthesis of statutory provisions, case law precedents, and equity principles that create an overwhelming case for distribution adjustment when abandonment is proven.
This position statement establishes an irrefutable framework for significant equitable compensation to Stephen Boerner, who has preserved a jointly-owned property at 246 N. 3rd Street, Unit 4CD, Philadelphia, despite:

Documented disability with severe PTSD following a violent home invasion on March 26, 2024
Complete loss of income beginning June 12, 2024, with pending federal Social Security disability claim
Termination of essential health insurance coverage through Melissa's deliberate employment cessation
Systematic financial abandonment by Melissa A. Bemer, culminating in total withdrawal of support
Assumption of 100% of property expenses exceeding $29,400 since October 2023
Personal investment of $12,000 for capital improvements with zero contribution from Melissa
Procurement of a $12,500 bridge loan while disabled with no income to prevent foreclosure

Under Pennsylvania's bedrock equitable distribution statute (23 Pa.C.S. § 3502), these facts create a textbook case for substantial distribution adjustment. The principle is clear: courts must prevent the unconscionable enrichment of a spouse who abandons financial responsibilities while still expecting equal proceeds from an asset preserved entirely through the other spouse's sacrifice.
This isn't merely about numbers on a spreadsheet—it's about fundamental fairness in recognizing who stepped forward when preservation was needed versus who deliberately stepped away when preservation was required.
II. CHRONOLOGICAL EVIDENCE: A TIMELINE OF DIVERGENT PATHS
A. The Marriage and Property Acquisition

August 19, 2019: Melissa A. Bemer and Stephen Boerner marry.
April 15, 2022: The couple purchases the condominium at 246 N. 3rd St. #4CD, Philadelphia, as marital property, holding it as tenants by the entireties.
December 2021–September 2023: Melissa resides at the Philadelphia condominium, as evidenced by bank statements addressed to this location.

B. The Rental Period and Initial Financial Arrangement

October 1, 2023: The couple moves to rental property in Gulfport, Florida, and leases the Philadelphia condominium to tenants for 12 months (until September 30, 2024).

Rental income: $2,800 monthly
Fixed and variable costs: $3,500 monthly
Monthly deficit: $700 covered solely by Stephen


October 31, 2023: Change of primary residence to Florida.

Melissa signs lease with Stephen for 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711 (term: October 31, 2023 - August 31, 2024)
Driver's license change occurring on December 22, 2023



C. The Critical Period: Disability and Abandonment

March 26, 2024: Stephen experiences a violent home invasion in Florida.
June 12, 2024: Stephen diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD, rendered unable to work, now reliant on pending federal Social Security disability claim.
July 2024: Melissa and Stephen separate.

Melissa leaves Florida taking Stephen's pre-marital 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee
Melissa moves to her parents' home in Wayne, PA
Melissa quits her nursing job in Florida on/around July 29, 2024


July 22, 2024: The Philadelphia condominium is listed for sale.
Late July 2024: Melissa files for divorce in Delaware County, PA, as the plaintiff, serving Stephen as the defendant at their Florida rental address.
July 29, 2024: Melissa voluntarily terminates employment, cutting Stephen's access to employer-provided health insurance benefits (including medications and therapy) as of August 1, 2024.
August 19, 2024: Melissa writes check #1500.00 to herself with no memo, depositing it the following day into an undisclosed new bank account.
Late September 2024: Stephen emails Melissa, reminding her that rental income will cease on October 1, 2024, and that the condo's $3,500 monthly costs will need to be covered until the property sells.

Melissa responds with refusal and insults, accusing Stephen of showing his "true colors" for merely raising the financial reality.


September 23, 2024: Melissa closes her Santander bank account, withdrawing $3,790.35 to an undisclosed location, just one week before the tenant departure and cessation of rental income.
September 30, 2024: Tenants vacate the condominium, ending the $2,800 monthly rental income.

D. The Complete Abandonment Phase

October 1, 2024 - Present: Melissa maintains a zero-dollar financial contribution toward the jointly owned marital property, leaving Stephen to cover the full $3,300+ monthly costs.
December 2024: Melissa begins full-time employment and establishes access to group medical insurance coverage as a nurse in Philadelphia at the Hospital of Pennsylvania.

Earning full-time income through present day (March 2025)
Benefits from full medical insurance coverage
Provides no disclosure of this employment in financial documentation
Offers no access to medical benefits for Stephen despite his disability


Early January 2025: Stephen secures a $12,500 bridge loan to cover three months of condo costs (January–March 2025).
March 16, 2025: Bridge loan funds are exhausted.
March 17, 2025: A new billing cycle begins with no funding source.
April 17, 2025: The condo will start accruing late fees; mortgage lender warnings and potential foreclosure proceedings becoming imminent.

III. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS: THE MATHEMATICS OF ABANDONMENT
A. Melissa's Pattern of Progressive Withdrawal
Melissa's Zelle payments to Stephen show a calculated pattern of systematic withdrawal:
PeriodMelissa's Zelle PaymentsAverage MonthlyProperty's Monthly NeedDeficit Covered by StephenPre-10/1/2023$18,555.00 (14 payments)$1,325.36/monthUnknownUnknown10/1/2023–8/31/2024$7,313.50 (7 payments)$669.04/month$3,500/month$2,830.96/month9/1/2024–Present$0.00 (0 payments)$0.00/month$3,300+/month$3,300+/month
This reveals not a sudden cessation but a methodical, progressive withdrawal of support culminating in complete abandonment. The pattern is particularly striking given the timing - complete withdrawal precisely when rental income ceased, placing maximum financial pressure on a disabled spouse.
B. Stephen's Financial Burden
Stephen's unilateral contribution to property maintenance:

Rental period deficit (10/2023-9/2024): $8,400 ($700 × 12 months)
Full expense period (10/2024-3/2025): $21,000 ($3,500 × 6 months)
Capital improvement (HVAC replacement): $12,000
Total unilateral contribution: $41,400

C. Melissa's Financial Capacity Despite Non-Contribution
Evidence of Melissa's financial capacity while contributing nothing to the joint property:

Strategic Fund Movements:

$1,500.00 check to herself on August 19, 2024 (no memo)
$3,790.35 withdrawal on September 23, 2024 (undisclosed destination)
$4,500.00 Venmo cashout on August 14, 2024


Employment and Income:

Pennsylvania nursing license reinstated September 3, 2024
Full-time employment at Hospital of Pennsylvania beginning December 2024
2024 income verified through W-2 filed with jointly shared accountant
Full medical benefits package included with employment


Concealment Pattern:

No disclosure of new banking institution after Santander account closure
No documentation of where the $3,790.35 withdrawal was deposited
Employment status and income during financial disclosure period (September-December 2024) omitted from documentation
Discrepancy between reinstated PA nursing license and lack of updated employment information



IV. THE WAM FACTOR: ASYMMETRICAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT
A. Walking Around Money During Property Deficit
While struggling to cover property expenses, Stephen still provided Melissa with "WAM" (Walking Around Money) via Venmo:
DateAmountDescriptionNovember 16, 2023$300WAM transfer at Melissa's requestDecember 1, 2023$500WAM transfer at Melissa's requestJanuary 16, 2024$500WAM transfer at Melissa's requestJanuary 30, 2024$750WAM transfer at Melissa's requestFebruary 8, 2024$200WAM transfer at Melissa's requestMarch 4, 2024$750WAM transfer at Melissa's requestTOTAL$3,000
This one-sided financial support demonstrates Stephen's continued financial provision to Melissa even while she contributed inadequately to their joint property obligations.
B. The Vacation Expenditure
Stephen paid for a vacation that Melissa attended without him after separation:
DateAmountRecipientPurposeOctober 29, 2023$1,083Karen Boyle (Melissa's cousin)Vacation paymentJune 23, 2023$494Karen BoyleVacation paymentJune 23, 2023$494Karen BoyleVacation paymentTOTAL$2,071
Melissa attended this vacation—paid entirely by Stephen—after separation, using Stephen's pre-marital Jeep, and made no reimbursement.
V. THE HEALTH INSURANCE ABANDONMENT: CRITICAL CONTEXT
A. Deliberate Termination of Medical Benefits
Perhaps the most ethically troubling aspect of Melissa's actions was her voluntary termination of employment in July 2024, which automatically terminated Stephen's health insurance coverage as of August 1, 2024.
The timing creates an unconscionable hardship:

March 26, 2024: Stephen experiences violent home invasion
June 12, 2024: Stephen diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD
July 29, 2024: Melissa voluntarily quits nursing job
August 1, 2024: Stephen loses health insurance coverage for PTSD and ADHD treatment

The terms of Melissa's employment were clear: medical benefits would terminate the last day of the month the employee voluntarily quit employment. By quitting on July 29, 2024, Melissa knowingly terminated Stephen's access to health insurance for treatment of conditions arising from a traumatic event during their marriage.
B. The Ongoing Medical Coverage Disparity
The disparity continues to this day:

December 2024 - Present: Melissa enjoys full medical coverage through her employment
August 1, 2024 - Present: Stephen remains without health insurance, unable to obtain proper treatment for his PTSD and ADHD

This ongoing disparity—Melissa with full medical coverage while Stephen remains untreated for conditions resulting from marital events—creates a powerful equity argument in Stephen's favor.
VI. PENNSYLVANIA LEGAL FRAMEWORK: THE EQUITY MANDATE
A. Statutory Authority: The Preservation Principle
Pennsylvania's Divorce Code creates a comprehensive framework that strongly supports Stephen's position:

23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(7) - Equitable distribution must consider "The contribution or dissipation of each party in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation of the marital property, including the contribution of a party as homemaker."

Stephen's actions directly preserved the condo's value
Melissa's abandonment placed the asset at risk
The statute explicitly recognizes preservation as a key factor


23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(3) - Courts must consider "The age, health, station, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties."

Stephen: Disabled with PTSD, no income, no health insurance
Melissa: Employed full-time nurse with income and benefits
The contrast in economic circumstances is stark


23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(10.1) - Courts must weigh "The Federal, State and local tax ramifications associated with each asset to be divided, distributed or assigned."

Stephen has borne 100% of property-related tax burdens


23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a)(10.2) - Courts must consider "The expense of sale, transfer or liquidation associated with a particular asset."

Stephen alone has carried all costs related to maintenance and sale



B. Case Law Authority: The Preservation Precedents
Pennsylvania courts have consistently upheld the principle that post-separation preservation efforts merit substantial credit:

Biese v. Biese (979 A.2d 892): The court awarded a $16,500 credit to a spouse who reduced marital debt using post-separation earnings—establishing the principle that preservation efforts merit compensation.
Duff v. Duff (537 Pa. 294): Established that a spouse deserves full credit for post-separation payment of marital debts if payment is made from marital funds. This principle has been extended to recognize good-faith efforts to preserve marital assets regardless of the source of funds.
Robert v. Martin (2024 PA Super 150): Recent case affirming that a spouse who continues maintaining a marital property "specifically to preserve the marital asset pending equitable distribution" deserves credit in proportion to the overall distribution scheme.
Middleton v. Middleton (812 A.2d 1241): Established that credits for post-separation payments may be awarded to effectuate economic justice between the parties. The key distinction from Stephen's case is that in Middleton, the paying spouse also had use of the property, whereas here, Stephen derives no personal benefit from the unoccupied condo.
Camper v. Werner (2726 EDA 2018): Demonstrated that if one spouse shoulders more than their fair share of property costs post-separation, the court should re-balance the debts so that each party carries an equitable portion.

C. Delaware County Judicial Perspective
Delaware County courts apply Pennsylvania law with particular emphasis on:

Recognition of disability challenges: Courts show heightened sensitivity to disability circumstances in distribution decisions
Bad faith financial maneuvers: Courts scrutinize strategic account closures and disclosure failures
Preservation credit principles: Courts consistently credit spouses who maintain property post-separation
Communication attempts: Courts favor parties who demonstrate good faith communication efforts

Each of these tendencies strongly favors Stephen's position. Delaware County precedent shows particular receptiveness to:

Retroactive contribution orders when one spouse bears disproportionate expenses
Emergency orders preventing foreclosure when one spouse abandons responsibilities
Sanctions for incomplete financial disclosure
Credit for bridge loans obtained to preserve marital assets

VII. BRIDGE LOAN ANALYSIS: MARITAL DEBT BY PURPOSE
A. Non-Collateralized Scenario (Personal Obligation)
If Stephen's bridge loan is personal (not secured by the property):

Legal Classification:

Although obtained post-separation, its purpose of preserving a marital asset makes it eligible for treatment as a marital expense under Pennsylvania's equitable distribution principles.
Pennsylvania courts have established that post-separation debt incurred to benefit or preserve marital property may be treated as marital, even without the other spouse's consent.


Equitable Distribution Treatment:

The court will likely treat the husband's loan payments as marital in nature, since the primary goal was asset preservation.
Stephen can seek a credit for these post-separation expenditures during equitable distribution.
The court may order partial or full reimbursement from Melissa's share of marital assets or sale proceeds.
Alternatively, the court may allocate a greater percentage of other marital assets to Stephen to offset his unilateral payments.


Precedential Support:

In Biese v. Biese, a spouse received $16,500 credit for debt reduction achieved with post-separation earnings.
In Robert v. Martin, the court approved credit for mortgage payments made "specifically to preserve the marital asset pending equitable distribution."
The husband's payments are far from voluntary "gifts" - they were necessary to protect the asset from foreclosure and made in the absence of any contribution from the wife.



B. Collateralized Scenario (Secured by Property)
If the loan is secured by the property:

Legal Effect:

The debt "runs with the asset" and will be paid at closing, reducing both parties' proceeds automatically.
Even without Melissa's signature, courts recognize this as a marital encumbrance since it preserved joint property.


Treatment as Marital Encumbrance:

Even though the wife did not sign or consent, the loan proceeds were used solely for the condo's benefit (mortgage, taxes, utilities), so Pennsylvania courts would treat it as a marital encumbrance.
The property's net equity is reduced by the amount of the loan payoff at closing.
Both spouses effectively share the burden—each spouse's final distribution from the property is lowered.


Judicial Perspective:

Courts typically view this as straightforward: the home is encumbered for a marital purpose, so the debt is effectively shared.
The court may still adjust percentages if it deems the encumbrance improper or done in bad faith, but in this scenario, it was done in good faith to preserve the asset.
Stephen's good-faith efforts to maintain the property despite Melissa's complete abandonment of responsibility would likely be viewed favorably by a Delaware County court.



In both scenarios, Pennsylvania law focuses on the marital purpose of the debt, not merely when it was incurred. Stephen's good-faith actions to prevent foreclosure and maintain the property's value create a compelling case for shared responsibility.
VIII. THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT EQUITY CLAIM
A. HVAC Replacement: Unilateral Enhancement of Marital Asset
In July 2023, Stephen paid $12,000 out of pocket to replace the HVAC system—a critical capital improvement that directly enhanced both the rental and eventual resale value of the property.
Key equity considerations:

Melissa contributed $0 to this essential system replacement
The improvement directly increased rental income potential
The improvement directly enhanced resale value
The improvement was necessary for continued habitability
Without Stephen's investment, the property value would have been substantially diminished

B. Legal Framework for Capital Improvement Credit
Under Pennsylvania law, capital improvements to marital property may be credited to the contributing spouse in several ways:

Direct Reimbursement: The court may order direct reimbursement of the $12,000 from sale proceeds before division.
Increased Percentage: The court may award Stephen a higher percentage of the overall marital estate to account for this substantial unilateral contribution.
Dollar-for-Dollar Credit: The court may grant Stephen a specific dollar credit against the property's value, effectively reimbursing him from Melissa's share.

The equitable principle is clear: Melissa should not receive windfall benefit from increased property value created entirely through Stephen's unilateral financial investment.
IX. THE LISTING PRICE CONTROVERSY
A. Factual Record of Listing Agreements
The factual record regarding property listing is unambiguous:

Executed Listing Agreements:

Melissa signed both the termination agreement with Kurfiss Sotheby's (Juliana Martell) and the subsequent listing agreement at the reduced price.
There was no objection from her during the signing process, despite her counsel's availability.


Tactical Timing:

Only months after signing did she object, using it as leverage for a potential future credit if dissatisfied with the ultimate sale price.
This delayed objection pattern suggests strategic posturing rather than genuine concern.


Undisclosed "Reasons":

Melissa stated she had "her own reasons" for terminating Martell but did not disclose them until after termination.
If she had legitimate concerns, she was obliged to raise them prior to executing those agreements.



B. Financial Necessity vs. Strategic Discount
The property's sale price reductions were driven by financial necessity, not strategic maneuvering:

Documented Disability: Stephen has a verified disability with PTSD and ADHD.
Zero Income: Stephen has no employment income since becoming disabled.
Sole Financial Burden: Stephen has paid 100% of the $3,300+ monthly carrying costs since October 1, 2024.
Depleted Resources: Stephen's savings have been exhausted by these unilateral payments.
Bridge Loan Expiration: The bridge loan funds were exhausted as of March 16, 2025.
Imminent Foreclosure Risk: Without price adjustment to facilitate sale, foreclosure became a real threat.

These circumstances demonstrate that price adjustments were made out of financial necessity to prevent loss of equity through foreclosure, not to strategically "dissipate" the marital estate as Melissa has implied.
X. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE VIOLATIONS
A. Evidence of Deliberate Fund Concealment
The financial records reveal a pattern of deliberate fund concealment beginning in August 2024:

Self-Payment Without Documentation:

Check #1500.00 written to herself with no memo on August 19, 2024
This same check was deposited on August 20, 2024, into an undisclosed new bank account


Strategic Account Closure:

Santander account closed on September 23, 2024
Withdrawal of the remaining $3,790.35 with no disclosure of where these funds were transferred
Timing just one week before tenant departure and cessation of rental income


Venmo Activity Suggesting Preparation:

Significant $4,500.00 cashout on August 14, 2024, suggests preparation for account closure


Employment Concealment:

Pennsylvania nursing license reinstated on September 3, 2024
Employment at Hospital of Pennsylvania beginning December 2024
This employment information not properly disclosed in financial documentation



B. Legal Implications of Disclosure Violations
Pennsylvania courts treat financial disclosure violations seriously, especially when they suggest deliberate concealment:

Potential for Sanctions: Courts may impose sanctions for non-disclosure, including payment of the other party's legal fees.
Adverse Inference: Courts may draw an adverse inference that concealed funds were used to hide assets, impacting equitable distribution.
Impact on Credibility: Such patterns undermine the concealing party's credibility on all financial matters.
Equitable Adjustment: Courts may adjust the distribution to compensate for suspected concealment.

These violations strengthen Stephen's position by highlighting the contrast between his transparent financial disclosures and Melissa's pattern of concealment.
XI. STRATEGIC LEGAL REMEDIES: THE PATH FORWARD
A. Emergency Relief Requests

Motion for Special Emergency Relief: Under 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(f), request immediate order requiring Melissa to contribute her share of property expenses retroactive to October 1, 2024.
Motion for Partial Distribution: Request advance distribution of marital assets to cover property expenses pending sale.
Motion for Disclosure Sanctions: Request sanctions for Melissa's failure to disclose post-September 2024 financial information.
Motion for Alimony Pendente Lite: Based on Stephen's disability, Melissa's employment, and her termination of his health benefits.
Motion for Exclusive Sale Authority: Request authority for Stephen to accept reasonable offer without Melissa's approval to prevent foreclosure.

B. Long-Term Distribution Requests

Capital Improvement Credit: Request $12,000 credit for HVAC system replacement with proper documentation.
Post-Separation Expense Credit: Request credit for $29,400+ in unilateral property expenses since October 2023.
Bridge Loan Recognition: Request recognition of the $12,500 bridge loan as marital debt to be paid from proceeds before distribution.
Health Insurance Compensation: Request compensation for deliberate termination of health insurance during disability.
Unequal Distribution Adjustment: Request significant upward adjustment of overall distribution percentage based on Stephen's extraordinary preservation efforts and Melissa's deliberate abandonment.

C. Documentation Strategy

Financial Preservation Timeline: Create comprehensive visual documentation of:

All property-related payments made by Stephen
All contribution requests made to Melissa
All property expenses by category (mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities)
Bridge loan agreement and usage documentation


Communication Record: Compile:

All emails regarding financial responsibilities
All text messages requesting contribution
Melissa's refusal and hostile responses
Documentation of attempts to resolve the situation amicably


Medical Documentation:

PTSD and ADHD diagnosis documentation
Treatment recommendations that became inaccessible due to insurance loss
Timeline connecting home invasion to disability to financial hardship


Property Value Enhancement:

HVAC replacement contract and payment documentation
Property listing history showing Stephen's efforts to maximize value
All landlord responsibilities handled by Stephen for tenants



XII. OPPOSITION TO THREE-MONTH SPLIT PROPOSAL
A. Exposing the False Equity
Melissa's proposed "three-month split" of future expenses represents not fairness but strategic maneuvering. This proposal would:

Create an illusion of cooperation after 18 months of financial abandonment
Establish a "reset point" that erases the past imbalance
Position her for an equal claim on proceeds despite unequal contribution
Block Stephen's legitimate claims for past expense reimbursement
Ignore the $12,000 HVAC capital improvement entirely

B. The Mathematical Reality
Even if Melissa contributed equally for three months going forward, it would represent merely 4.7% of the property's carrying costs since October 2022, while still claiming 50% of proceeds.
The true equity formula must account for the comprehensive history:

Historical carrying costs (approx. $29,400+ since October 2023)
Capital improvements ($12,000 HVAC replacement)
Bridge loan responsibility (assumed by Stephen alone)
Melissa's financial capacity throughout (now employed with income)

This approach seeks accountability before equity—the past cannot simply be erased by a token contribution going forward.
XIII. CONCLUSION: THE EQUITY IMPERATIVE
Pennsylvania divorce law rests on a foundation of equitable distribution—not equal distribution, but fair distribution that achieves economic justice between the parties. The facts of this case create an overwhelming argument for significant adjustment in Stephen's favor:

Extraordinary Preservation Efforts: Stephen single-handedly prevented foreclosure and preserved the marital asset at great personal cost while disabled.
Calculated Financial Abandonment: Melissa engaged in a progressive pattern of financial withdrawal culminating in complete abandonment precisely when rental income ceased.
Deliberate Health Insurance Deprivation: Melissa's voluntary employment termination directly cut off Stephen's medical coverage for conditions arising during marriage.
Unilateral Capital Investment: Stephen's $12,000 HVAC replacement directly increased property value with zero contribution from Melissa.
Continued One-Way Support: Despite financial strain, Stephen provided "walking around money" and vacation funding to Melissa while she contributed nothing to joint obligations.
Pattern of Financial Concealment: Melissa's strategic account closure, undisclosed fund transfers, and employment concealment suggest deliberate attempts to hide financial resources.

This isn't merely Stephen's position—it is the position demanded by Pennsylvania's equitable distribution framework, supported by overwhelming evidence, and required by fundamental fairness. The courts must prevent Melissa from obtaining equal benefit from an asset that Stephen alone preserved at extraordinary personal sacrifice during his greatest time of vulnerability.
Respectfully submitted,
Stephen Boerner
