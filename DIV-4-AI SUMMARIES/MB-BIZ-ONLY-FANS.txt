MELISSA's employment with Tampa General Hospital commenced in late May 2024. Prior to this date, specifically from late December until May 2024, STEPHEN experienced a lack of essential benefits and medical care. Additionally, a home invasion incident was documented on March 26, 2024. It is noted that the marital relationship was characterized as positive prior to this incident. 

In January 2024, both parties initiated separate business ventures; STEPHEN focused on online education and AI, while MELISSA pursued a business in the adult entertainment sector. Despite a substantial initial investment of time and resources, MELISSA's venture was ultimately discontinued following the home invasion on March 26, 2024, for reasons unrelated to said incident, citing simply that "it's just not the right time."

On March 26, 2024, it was formally acknowledged that STEPHEN BOERNER would provide support for the establishment of a business solely for MELISSA BEMER.  It was explicitly agreed that STEPHEN would retain no ownership interest in this venture.  During this period, STEPHEN undertook dual roles, pursuing his own online education and AI consultancy while concurrently acting as an advisor to MELISSA, contributing both time and capital.  Concerns subsequently arose regarding MELISSA's long-term commitment to the business and the potential dissipation of STEPHEN's invested resources.  

Apprehension existed that MELISSA might disengage from the venture, thereby jeopardizing STEPHEN's most valuable asset: his time.  These concerns materialized when, despite STEPHEN's extensive efforts—including investments in educational materials, technology, and considerable time dedicated to content production for MELISSA's company launch—it became unequivocally apparent that MELISSA sought to terminate her involvement in the business venture.  MELISSA's decision to halt business operations, subsequent to the aforementioned date of March 26, 2024, has been duly noted, reflecting a significant turning point in the timeline of events surrounding the establishment of her enterprise.
