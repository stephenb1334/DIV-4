**Position Statement of Stephen Boerner**  
*Re: 246-48 N. 3rd Street, Unit 4CD | Divorce Proceedings – Delaware County, PA*

I submit this statement to establish a clear, factual record of events concerning the jointly owned property at 246-48 North 3rd Street, Unit 4CD, Philadelphia, PA. My goal is not to engage in emotional rebuttals but to correct certain mischaracterizations and ensure an equitable outcome grounded in the documented financial reality.

I welcome transparency and closure. However, any resolution must incorporate the true history of this property’s financial burdens—borne overwhelmingly by me for the past eighteen months.

### 1. **Listing Price Objection**  
**Signed Agreements Override Counsel’s Narrative**

The opposing party claims the property may be “listed below market value.” This disregards:

- **Executed Listing Agreements**:  
  - Ms. Bemer **signed** both the termination agreement with Kurfiss Sotheby’s (Juliana Martell) and the subsequent listing agreement at a reduced price.  
  - There was **no objection** from her during the signing process, despite her counsel’s availability.  
- **Tactical Timing**:  
  - Only now—months after signing—does she object, using it as leverage for a potential future credit if dissatisfied with the ultimate sale price.

Further, Ms. Bemer stated she had “her own reasons” for terminating Martell but did not disclose them until after termination. If she had legitimate concerns, she was obliged to raise them **prior** to executing those agreements.

### 2. **Financial Contributions**  
**Timeline and Bank Records Reflect the True Picture**

Ms. Bemer’s own records note the following Zelle transfers to me:

| Period                                       | Amount      |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Before Sept 2022**                         | \$3,805.00  |
| **Sept 30, 2022 – Sept 30, 2023**            | \$7,500.00  |
| **Oct 1, 2023 – Sept 30, 2024**              | \$7,000.00  |
| **Total**                                    | \$18,305.00 |

These amounts must be compared against actual carrying costs:

- **Oct 1, 2023 – Sept 30, 2024**: Unit was rented at \$2,800/month; mortgage + HOA exceeded \$3,500/month, leaving a \$700/month gap I covered alone.  
- **Since Oct 1, 2024**: The property has been vacant; I have paid **100%** of the monthly carrying costs (over \$3,300/month).  
- **Post-October 2022**: Ms. Bemer’s payments have been sporadic reimbursements—not consistent or proportional cost-sharing.

In truth, **I have carried this property almost entirely by myself** throughout this period.

### 3. **Capital Improvement: HVAC Replacement**

In July 2023, I covered **\$12,000** out of pocket to replace the HVAC system, a critical capital improvement that enhanced both the rental and eventual resale value. Ms. Bemer contributed **nothing**—financially or otherwise.

Yet she now asserts an equal claim to the increased equity resulting from repairs and upgrades she did not help fund.

---

### 4. **Proposed Three-Month Split**  
**Legally Framed but Strategically Deceptive**

Opposing counsel’s proposal—splitting mortgage and HOA for three months—appears fair in isolation but ignores prior history. It would:

- Portray Ms. Bemer as suddenly “cooperative” while **never addressing** her lack of contributions these past 18 months.  
- Create the illusion of equity “going forward” without remedying the prior financial imbalance.  
- Attempt to block any later claim I have for **reimbursement of past carrying costs** or the **\$12,000 HVAC** outlay.

Without recognizing the financial burdens I have already sustained, this proposal cannot be deemed equitable.

---

### 5. **Sale Price Reality**  
**Not a Discount for Strategy, but a Last-Ditch Necessity**

The property’s sale price reductions reflect more than just market trends:

- I have a **documented disability** and severely limited financial runway.  
- I face \$3,300+ in monthly carrying costs on a vacant property.  
- Ms. Bemer has refused to contribute anything since the tenant left.  
- The financial pressure forced me to lower the asking price—not because the “market” demanded it, but because the alternative was potential foreclosure or further hardship.

If there is any “dissipation of the marital estate,” it is not coming from me. On the contrary, I have preserved this asset under dire personal and financial strain while Ms. Bemer stood by without assistance.

---

### 6. **Crypto**  
**An Irrelevant Distraction**

Opposing counsel has alluded to cryptocurrency as if it indicates hidden funds or non-disclosure. If further detail is needed, I will provide it—but only with full **reciprocal disclosure** of Ms. Bemer’s financials and liabilities. Transparency must go both ways.

---

### **Closing Position**

This condo is more than just a jointly titled asset—it is a prime example of **financial abandonment**. Over the last 18 months:

- I paid the mortgage, HOA fees, and emergency repairs alone.  
- Ms. Bemer’s contributions have been minimal, inconsistent, and overshadowed by the property’s ongoing costs.  
- Her newly raised objections and claims were never communicated at the time of signing or payment, only surfacing now for strategic advantage.

For any resolution to be truly equitable, the principle of **“accountability before equity”** must be applied. Past financial burdens cannot be erased by a short-term gesture.

**Respectfully submitted,**  
**Stephen Boerner**
