with 10% down payment, we'll need to include PMI. Let's work backwards again from the $3,493.00 monthly payment, but with 10% down:

Current assumptions:
- Federal interest rate: 7%
- Mortgage rate: ~7.75% for well-qualified buyers
- 10% down payment
- PMI required (typically 0.5-1.2% of loan amount annually for this scenario)
- Philadelphia property tax rate: 1.3998%

Working backwards with the $3,493 monthly payment:

Let's break down the new monthly components:

```
Monthly Principal: $545
Monthly Interest: $1,773
Monthly Property Tax: $765
Monthly Home Insurance: $165
Monthly PMI: $245
------------------------
Total Monthly Fixed: $3,493
```

This suggests:
- Home Purchase Price: ~$440,000
- Down Payment (10%): $44,000
- Loan Amount: $396,000

Key differences from 20% down scenario:
1. Lower purchase price possible due to PMI eating into monthly payment capacity
2. Added PMI cost (~0.75% annually of loan amount)
3. Slightly lower property tax due to lower home value
4. Slightly lower insurance due to lower home value
5. Higher loan amount relative to home value

The monthly payment breakdown reflects:
- P&I payment higher due to larger loan amount
- PMI required until reaching 20% equity
- Property taxes slightly lower due to lower overall purchase price
- Insurance slightly lower due to lower replacement value

This scenario is actually more realistic for many Philadelphia buyers in 2025, as saving 20% down payment ($88,000+ in previous scenario) would be challenging for many buyers in this price range.

The PMI can typically be removed once the loan-to-value ratio reaches 80% (either through payments or home value appreciation), which could take several years depending on market conditions and extra principal payments.
