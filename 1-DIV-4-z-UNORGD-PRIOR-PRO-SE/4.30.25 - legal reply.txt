it has taken me some time to compose this. "This" started as a reply, a reply to Melissa's lawyer, Marilyn XYZ (last name). She wrote to my lawyer, Maria XYZ (last name) on March 16, 2025 (date check) and April 15, 2025 (date check). 

it has taken me time, much time, in thought, in emotion, and sadness, and in disabled mind, to mold together what i'm told needs to be a focus on my future self, my well-being, my defense...such a defense, in the eyes of law, with such great unfortunate precedence and requirements of parties, requires entrance of ourselves into the most disgusting of traits of society and how we've decided to govern ourselves. In this engagement, when services are fueld by retainers of scholars, law-minded professionals tasked with seeking the most, protecting the most, removes the subjects from any real freedom of choice once entered. We may receive optinality in the form a direction A or direction B, as presented as such by the legal representatives we employ, only to deploy respectively. they may give us the sense of freedom of choice, but once we've enetered this arrangement of divorce, A vs B, exists in the narrow, pre-determined direction that came without knowledge of its parts at the time of signing the legal contract. 


societal resolution , and thus, will take you time,
