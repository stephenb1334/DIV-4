**RE: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Ongoing unauthorized listing despite executed termination**

Dear Mr. Pearson:

Kurfiss Sotheby International Realty has received my detailed documentation chronicling unprofessional and unethical conduct that fundamentally contradicts the core values and standards of excellence your brand publicly champions.

The issues have escalated significantly, creating mounting liabilities that now demand executive attention. 

I question whether your brokerage, and the individuals acting on its behalf, fully comprehend the severe ramifications of their actions. Their apparent attempts to dismiss my concerns, deprioritize critical contractual obligations, and potentially conceal their conduct from leadership are creating consequences that extend far beyond the immediate situation. 

This extremely sensitive and time-critical matter continues to be exacerbated by key representatives of Kurfiss-Sotheby's who appear unaware that they're generating liability that transcends their personal responsibility—directly undermining your firm's hard-earned reputation and creating significant legal exposure that could affect your organization's standing in the Philadelphia luxury real estate market for years to come.

Given my current circumstances, this formal communication represents my only viable recourse. As the responsible party for a marital asset portfolio, Pennsylvania law and established legal doctrine obligate me to exercise the highest standard of care and protection—obligations I cannot fulfill while your brokerage continues its current course of action. I take no satisfaction in watching this liability grow in direct proportion to continued inaction, as it ultimately serves neither my interests nor the long-term reputation of Kurfiss-Sotheby's.

After precisely 234 days as a seller-client without achieving a successful sale, I have submitted thorough documentation evidencing serious conflicts of interest and deceptive practices carried out by your brokerage. These documented incidents form a pattern that demands your immediate attention as the principal authority within your organization.

Due to the unresolved issues regarding our executed termination agreement, I find myself concerned about how this situation reflects on the distinguished Kurfiss Sotheby's reputation for excellence and professionalism. The continued unauthorized listing of my property at 246 N. 3rd St. Unit #4CD, Philadelphia, PA 19106 seems inconsistent with the exceptional client service and integrity that distinguishes your brand in the luxury real estate market. I'm reaching out directly to you because I believe you value maintaining the premium standards that make Kurfiss Sotheby's unique. Your personal attention to resolving this matter involving your company and agent Juliana Martell would demonstrate the commitment to client relationships and ethical business practices that your brand has long represented.

Such blatant disregard for contractual obligations, deliberate failure to acknowledge documented violations, and willful abandonment of legal responsibilities—particularly your unconscionable decision to cease all communication during critical contractual deadlines with legal implications—not only tarnishes your personal reputation but systematically erodes the credibility you've labored to establish among your employees and within the broader market. As a leader who publicly champions integrity in business practices, your organization's actions in this matter represent a profound betrayal of the very principles you claim to exemplify and promote.

**FACTS:**

1. On March 10-11, 2025, a termination agreement (DocuSign Envelope ID: CAFB70A6-C3F1-41A4-8AE1-52F627951A55) was fully executed between myself and Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty.

2. This termination agreement, drafted by your brokerage, explicitly states: "As of 6:59 PM on 3/10/25, the listing contract for both rent and for sale are hereby terminated."

3. This agreement was properly countersigned by Linda Danese as your brokerage's representative on March 10, 2025.

4. Despite this legally binding termination, your brokerage continues to market my property and maintains active MLS listings, in direct violation of both our agreement and Pennsylvania real estate regulations.

5. Your agent, Juliana Martell, holds a conflicting position as Vice President of the HOA Executive Board for The Commons at New Street Condominium, where my property is located, giving her access to confidential financial information regarding my account status.

6. Ms. Martell failed to disclose this conflict of interest in writing as required by Pennsylvania Code (49 Pa. Code §35.283), which states: "A licensee has a continuing obligation to disclose to a principal any conflict of interest in a reasonably practicable period of time after the licensee learns or should have learned of the conflict of interest."

7. Ms. Martell engaged in potentially deceptive practices by misrepresenting a six-month renewal listing agreement as merely a "$1,000 price adjustment" in January 2025. This is documented in text messages where she stated:
   - "I feel a small (even if $1000) sales price reduction would be a good refresher..." (Jan 13, 11:29 AM)
   - "Ok let's start with the $1000 reduction - I'll send a new contract shortly." (Jan 14, 3:51 PM)
   - "Melissa - please sign the contract when you can for the new price, Steve signed last night." (Jan 15, 11:31 AM)

8. This characterization obscured the material nature of this document, which was in fact a complete six-month renewal of our listing agreement. Such actions potentially violate Pennsylvania's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, which prohibits "misrepresenting the qualities or features of a good or service" and "any other deceptive or fraudulent act" causing consumer confusion or misunderstanding.

9. In the context of disclosed divorce proceedings between co-owners, Ms. Martell's undisclosed dual role created a situation where her actions potentially violated 49 Pa. Code §35.314, which requires taking "no action that is adverse or detrimental to either party's interest in the transaction" when serving as an agent.

10. I am now forced to disclose in this correspondence that I have a documented disability, a private matter I would not otherwise need to reveal. Your brokerage's failure to honor a properly executed termination agreement has compelled me to expose this private health information to demonstrate the particularly vulnerable position in which I have been placed by these circumstances. My co-owner has been unresponsive for over 54 hours regarding this urgent matter.

11. This property constitutes a marital asset subject to equitable distribution under Pennsylvania law, and I am acting to protect this asset.

12. In response to these serious ethical and legal concerns, Ms. Martell has dismissed legitimate grievances by merely stating she's "sorry to hear I'm unhappy with services," refusing to acknowledge the documented conflict of interest or address the concerns about her marketing practices.

I feel compelled to note that despite my best efforts to coordinate with legal counsel, my legal representation has been unresponsive for 17 days, since February 25th, 2025. 

This lack of communication places me in the difficult position of acting independently to protect this marital property without the benefit of equal representation. Pennsylvania law recognizes the need to take protective measures of marital property in such circumstances, and I am acting in good faith to preserve our mutual interests while facing this challenging situation.

I must emphasize that this urgent matter has significant financial implications. As the sole individual maintaining the financial obligations of this property, I have continued to make all required payments including mortgage, property taxes, and utility costs without contribution from my co-owner. March 17th will mark the beginning of a new billing statement period, which—due to the circumstances described herein—will be the first billing cycle to go unpaid.



I have developed a financially viable strategy to address this situation, as is my responsibility under Pennsylvania law to protect marital assets. However, I cannot implement this plan while the property remains improperly listed by Kurfiss Sotheby's in direct violation of our executed termination agreement.

The termination agreement is binding based on its explicit language and existing signatures from both Kurfiss Sotheby's representative Linda Danese and myself as an authorized property owner. Pennsylvania courts have consistently recognized that when a binding contract contains clear termination provisions, those provisions must be honored by all parties.

I must emphasize that despite my spouse, Melissa Bemer, being a co-signer on both the property deed and the listing agreements, I have been independently bearing the entire financial burden of this jointly owned marital property since October 1, 2024, with no direct contributions made by my spouse since September of 2023. Since October 1, 2024, I have personally covered approximately $3,500 monthly in fixed and variable costs with no tenant income to offset these expenses. Prior to that, from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, the property generated $2,800 in monthly rent, with me personally covering the difference between rental income and property expenses.

Due to this untenable financial arrangement, I was compelled to secure a $12,500 bridge loan—which constitutes marital debt—to cover the expenses for our jointly owned marital property from January through March 2025. This emergency funding has now been completely exhausted following the final payment made prior to the March 16, 2025 deadline. For approximately 18 months, I have solely borne all financial obligations for this marital property without any contribution from my spouse, despite our equal legal ownership. This sustained period of unilateral financial responsibility clearly establishes my legitimate authority to take protective action regarding this jointly-purchased marital asset. While my spouse maintains the financial capacity to contribute, they have consistently demonstrated unwillingness to do so, leaving me as the sole financial steward of our shared property.

Each day your brokerage continues to illegally market this listing, you directly impede my ability to mitigate financial harm and cause measurable financial damage to this marital asset. Your ongoing unauthorized marketing activities, combined with your failure to acknowledge communications, respond to formal requests, or address contractual deadlines, constitute a clear breach of our executed agreement. These actions result in quantifiable financial damages that accumulate daily, creating a documented pattern of harmful conduct that directly affects the value and marketability of this property. Your continued non-compliance has created an evidentiary record of deliberate disregard for contractual obligations and professional standards. 



**DEMANDS:**

I hereby demand the following immediate actions:

1. Complete removal of all MLS listings and marketing materials for this property by 5:00 PM ET today, March 13, 2025.

2. Written confirmation from an authorized executive officer or the General Counsel of Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty directed to me, Stephen J. Boerner, confirming complete removal from all listing services and marketing platforms by the same deadline. This confirmation should be sent via email to stephen.boerner@gmail.com.

3. Immediate cessation of all communication between Juliana Martell and either myself or Melissa Bemer except through: (a) designated legal counsel, (b) DocuSign's automated notifications related to the completion of the termination process, or (c) written confirmation of compliance with the demands specified herein sent via email to stephen.boerner@gmail.com.

4. Written acknowledgment from an authorized executive officer or the General Counsel of Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty addressing Ms. Martell's undisclosed conflict of interest, concerning renewal practices, and your brokerage's plan to address these ethical issues. This acknowledgment should be sent directly to stephen.boerner@gmail.com.

**CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION:**

Please be advised that failure to comply with these demands by the specified deadline will leave me no choice but to:

1. File formal complaints with the Pennsylvania Real Estate Commission, Greater Philadelphia Association of REALTORS®, Pennsylvania Association of REALTORS®, and National Association of REALTORS® Ethics Committee.

2. Pursue legal action through the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas to enforce the termination agreement.

3. File a consumer protection complaint with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office under the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law.

4. Seek damages for each day of continued unauthorized marketing of my property in violation of our executed termination agreement.

Given the serious nature of these violations, documented conflict of interest, and concerning circumstances surrounding this transaction—including my documented health condition, ongoing divorce proceedings, and the current unresponsiveness of my co-owner regarding critical property decisions—I urge you to give this matter your immediate personal attention. Pennsylvania law recognizes my responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect marital assets in such situations. While I would prefer to resolve this matter without further escalation, I am fully prepared to pursue all available legal and regulatory remedies should that become necessary.

I expect your written confirmation of compliance by the deadline specified above.


Sincerely,

Stephen J. Boerner
