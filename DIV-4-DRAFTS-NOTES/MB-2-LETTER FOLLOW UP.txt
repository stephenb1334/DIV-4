# NOTICE OF IMPENDING MORTGAGE DEFAULT AND UNILATERAL ACTIONS TO PRESERVE MARITAL PROPERTY

**Date: March 11, 2025**

Melissa,

## Termination of Kurfiss Sotheby's Listing Agreement

As detailed in my March 10, 2025 formal demand letter to Juliana Martell and Kurfiss Sotheby's International Realty (attached as Addendum A), I have terminated our listing agreement effective immediately. This morning, March 11, 2025, both myself and the brokerage firm have signed the termination agreement. Your signature is the final requirement to complete this process.

This provides you a small window of opportunity to either sign and comply with the reasoning for my unilateral actions detailed below, or decline – at which point a different series of events will unfold to ensure the MLS listing is withdrawn and my established plans move forward.

## Final Payment Made and Financial Exhaustion

This morning, March 11, 2025, I made my final payment to Mr. Cooper Loans covering both the mortgage and property tax statement period ending March 16, 2025. This payment of $2,494.13 (comprising $1,770.98 in principal and interest, and $723.15 in escrow for Philadelphia property taxes) represents the last financial contribution I am able to make. I have completely exhausted all personal financial resources, including the bridge loan funds allocated for this purpose.

Beyond this mortgage payment, I have also covered the monthly HOA fees ($813), utilities (primarily electricity at approximately $150), and homeowners insurance premiums that collectively bring the monthly carrying cost to approximately $3,470. Since October 1, 2024, I have solely borne these expenses without any contribution from you whatsoever.

## Financial Burden and Pattern of Non-Contribution

The consistent pattern of your non-contribution creates a clear record of financial abandonment:

| Month | Stephen's Contribution | Melissa's Contribution |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Oct 2024 | $3,472 | $0 |
| Nov 2024 | $3,472 | $0 |
| Dec 2024 | $3,470.39 | $0 |
| Jan 2025 | $3,470.39 | $0 |
| Feb 2025 | $3,470.39 | $0 |
| Mar 2025 | $3,470.39 | $0 |
| **TOTAL** | **$20,825.56** | **$0** |

This financial abandonment, coupled with the property's continued market stagnation, has forced me to take decisive action. I have already secured the services of a realtor who specializes in fire sale strategies for properties of urgent status. Rather than continuing the failed approach of targeting the razor's edge of the top end of the market – which has proven intolerable of our price and strategy – we will leapfrog to the bottom range of potential sale prices.

Our goal is to unload the property before foreclosure proceedings begin. I have identified $365,000 as the absolute bottom sale price that would allow a clean break with no proceeds but also no additional money spent at closing. The strategy is to list within a range slightly higher than $365,000, with a clear path to reduce to that number should market duration necessitate it to avoid foreclosure.

This approach would protect the marital estate as your months of financial non-contribution constitute abandonment under Pennsylvania law.

## Unsolicited Proposals and Lack of Legal Representation

Your recent actions have demonstrated an alarming pattern of circumventing proper legal channels, placing both yourself and the marital estate at significant risk:

On February 25, 2025, at 2:30 PM, you sent an unsolicited email proposal suggesting a 50/50 split of assets, including the condo's net proceeds, completely ignoring the $10,414.39 in mortgage payments I've made since October 2024 and the property's dire financial state.

On March 3, 2025, at 10:15 AM, you responded to information I shared about third-party data and sale strategy with a counterproposal to your own initial proposal, reducing the listing price to $415,000 based on a misunderstanding of the information provided.

On March 5, 2025, you sent an ultimatum with an arbitrary compliance deadline of March 7, 2025, demonstrating a complete disregard for the actual timelines dictated by mortgage obligations and market realities.

I immediately forwarded your first unsolicited proposal to my legal counsel and have not received any response or guidance. This follows the concerning December 2024 financial disclosure submission when both parties submitted documentation, but my lawyer was absent from evaluation, review, and provided not a single shred of counsel. I have been placed in an unfair position with lacking legal representation while facing your unsolicited proposals and arbitrary ultimatums.

These "back-of-the-napkin" proposals, devoid of legal oversight, are impossible to see as anything but an emotional, irrational, inattentive threat to yourself and the marital assets. The debt market ticks onward regardless of divorce proceedings, and I had no choice but to assemble the data and a small team that will collectively support me in the sale of this property, as opposed to being led by a single negligent, deceptive realtor while we remained sitting ducks for another six months without a sale.

Should you be considering a rental strategy for the property at $2,800 for six months or one year, preemptively understand that this would be demonstratively the wrong decision. I have already conducted a full, exhaustive third-party analysis which confirms this. The current moment does not allow time for your review and further questions of that strategy, as there are more reasons against it than can fit appropriately within this letter.

## An Opportunity for Collaboration

I am extending an olive branch: If you sign the termination agreement issued by the brokerage firm on March 10, 2025 at 6:59 PM and comply with the necessary sale strategy outlined herein, this does not have to force my hand in ongoing unilateral decisions. I welcome a collaborative approach and am open to sharing more details about the strategy and introducing you to the small team I have assembled to take over decision-making related to the property.

You are welcome to join this team and have your voice heard, so long as you understand that my unilateral authority must remain in place due to the circumstances stated herein. However, I must be absolutely clear: even if you sign and then subsequently attempt to slow down the direction and speed which must be maintained to protect both our financial interests and the marital estate, my unilateral rights will be imposed without hesitation. The timeline for action is non-negotiable given the impending default.

## Bridge Loan Status and Impending Default

On January 3, 2025, I secured a $12,500 bridge loan to cover mortgage and maintenance expenses through March 16, 2025. Under Pennsylvania law (23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3501(b)), this constitutes marital debt as it was incurred solely to preserve our marital property.

The bridge loan covered:
- Three mortgage payment periods (Dec 17, 2024 - Mar 16, 2025) totaling $7,482.39
- Remaining funds allocated to maintenance costs to keep the property marketable

I must inform you that I am financially unable to continue mortgage payments beyond March 16, 2025. Starting April 16, 2025, the mortgage will become delinquent, initiating a 30-day notice period under Pennsylvania law (37 Pa. Code § 13.21), followed by potential foreclosure proceedings, including a sheriff's sale, within 90–120 days, risking total equity loss.

**CRITICAL FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES:** In foreclosure proceedings, all equity in the property will be lost. Bank-seized properties typically sell at 60-70% of market value, with proceeds first covering the outstanding mortgage (projected at $342,118.83 by March 16, 2025), legal fees, penalties, and auction costs. This means we will receive zero proceeds from a property that should yield substantial equity if sold properly.

## Real Estate Listing Status and Market Failure

The property has been listed for over 230 days with no offers at the current price. Independent market analyses and buyer feedback consistently show the property is significantly overpriced:

- 57% of potential buyers explicitly stated the price is "too high" in documented feedback from 12 showings
- Third-party appraisals indicate buyers would need to invest $50,000-$75,000 in renovation costs
- Kurfiss Sotheby's ineffective minimal reduction strategy (token reductions of only $1,000 on October 15, 2024, and December 1, 2024—representing just 0.2% changes) has failed to address fundamental price objections
- The property has been stigmatized after 223+ days on market with no progress

These market realities, combined with your unwavering support for the failed pricing strategy and overpricing, have directly contributed to the property's failure to sell, exacerbating my financial burden and validating my unilateral intervention.

## Legal Authority for My Unilateral Actions

I am acting under established Pennsylvania legal authority for the following reasons:

1. **Disability-Based Necessity Doctrine:** My documented PTSD and ADHD diagnoses from April 2024 (following the March 26, 2024 home invasion) establish special standing under Pennsylvania case law (Williams v. Williams, Horning v. Horning) for unilateral action when necessary to preserve assets.

2. **Abandoned Medical Care Responsibility:** Your voluntary termination from Tampa General Hospital on July 28, 2024, ended my health insurance during active PTSD treatment, despite my researched FMLA options that would have maintained coverage.

3. **Financial Abandonment:** You have contributed nothing toward the property's expenses since October 2024, despite joint ownership responsibilities under Pennsylvania law.

4. **Preservation of Marital Assets:** Pennsylvania courts consistently recognize (23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3502(a)) that actions to prevent dissipation of marital assets are permitted even without mutual consent. Your reckless disregard, disconnected proposals, and support for the realtor's failed strategy compel me to terminate financial support, remove the property from the MLS, and pursue a fire sale to avert further loss.

5. **Unilateral Debt Authority:** Under Hicks v. Kubit (758 A.2d 202, Pa. Super. 2000) and Patwardhan v. Brabant (439 A.2d 784, Pa. Super. 1982), one spouse may incur debt to preserve marital property without the other's consent. My $12,500 bridge loan is a marital debt, lawfully executed to prevent default and protect the property's value.

6. **Constructive Legal Abandonment:** Your direct engagement outside attorney oversight, evidenced by your unsolicited email proposal on February 25, 2025, a second proposal on March 3, 2025, and a March 5th ultimatum demanding compliance by March 7th, demonstrates disregard for proper legal channels. These actions create a devastating paper trail of your negligence.

7. **Imminent Financial Harm Protection:** With foreclosure imminent, Pennsylvania law (23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3505) explicitly permits unilateral action to prevent irreparable harm to marital assets.

## Required Immediate Action

To prevent foreclosure proceedings and total equity loss, I require your immediate cooperation with:

1. Signing the attached Kurfiss Sotheby's termination agreement by March 13, 2025
2. Agreeing to the immediate fire sale strategy with a listing range of $375,000-$399,000
3. Acknowledging the bridge loan as marital debt to be prioritized in any property settlement

I have retained all communications, financial records, medical documentation, and legal research supporting my legal authority to act. While I would strongly prefer your cooperation, Pennsylvania law provides clear grounds for me to proceed unilaterally to preserve our marital assets if you decline.

Please respond with your signed termination agreement and acknowledgment of these terms by March 13, 2025.

Sincerely,

Stephen J. Boerner
