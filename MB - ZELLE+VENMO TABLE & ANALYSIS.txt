In the context of a divorce, financial disclosure is a critical process where both parties are required to provide a complete and transparent accounting of their finances, typically including bank statements, income, expenses, assets, and liabilities for a specified period. Here, the disclosure period is early 2022 to the end of December 2024, but Melissa A. Bemer closed her Santander bank account on 09/30/24 with a final withdrawal of $3,790.35, and there is no record of where this amount was transferred or what financial activity occurred afterward. Let’s analyze whether this constitutes a misstep on her part and what it might indicate.

Is Closing the Account on 09/30/24 a Misstep?
Yes, closing the account on 09/30/24 without providing records of the $3,790.35 withdrawal or subsequent financial activity through the end of December 2024 can be considered a misstep in the context of divorce financial disclosure requirements. Here’s why:

Incomplete Disclosure Period:
The required disclosure period extends to the end of December 2024, but Melissa’s account closure on 09/30/24 means there are three months (October to December 2024) unaccounted for in her Santander records. Divorce proceedings typically require full transparency for the entire specified period, and failing to provide financial records for these months breaches that obligation.
Lack of Transparency on the $3,790.35 Withdrawal:
The final transaction on 09/25/24, labeled “CLOSING TRANSACTION - WITHDRAWAL” of $3,790.35, brought the account balance to $0.00 by 09/30/24. However, there is no record of where this significant sum was transferred (e.g., another bank account, cash withdrawal, payment to a third party). In divorce proceedings, all large transactions must be documented to ensure they are not attempts to hide assets or manipulate financial records. The absence of this information raises concerns about transparency.
Failure to Document Subsequent Activity:
After closing the account, Melissa likely transferred the $3,790.35 to another account or used it in some capacity (e.g., cash, investments, payments). Without records of her financial activity from 10/01/24 to 12/31/24, the other party in the divorce cannot assess whether these funds were used for legitimate purposes or potentially hidden, dissipated, or transferred to obscure assets. This gap violates the principle of full financial disclosure.
Legal and Ethical Obligations:
In most jurisdictions, divorce laws require both parties to disclose all financial activity during the specified period, even if an account is closed before the period ends. Melissa’s closure of the account without providing subsequent records (e.g., statements from a new bank account where the $3,790.35 was deposited) could be interpreted as non-compliance with discovery rules. This may lead to legal consequences, such as sanctions, adverse inferences, or a court order to produce additional records.
Timing of Closure:
The account closure on 09/30/24, just three months before the end of the disclosure period, could be viewed as suspicious, especially since it coincides with a large withdrawal. Courts often scrutinize last-minute financial maneuvers during divorce proceedings to ensure they are not attempts to obscure funds.
What Does This Show?
The closure of the account on 09/30/24 with a $3,790.35 withdrawal and no record of subsequent activity may suggest several possibilities, ranging from benign to concerning, depending on the context and intent:

Potential Intent to Conceal Assets:
The lack of transparency about the $3,790.35 withdrawal and the absence of financial records for October to December 2024 could suggest an attempt to hide assets. In divorce proceedings, courts are wary of parties dissipating or concealing funds to reduce the marital estate subject to division. Transferring the money to an undisclosed account, converting it to cash, or using it to pay third parties without documentation might be interpreted as an effort to obscure Melissa’s true financial position.
Poor Financial Record-Keeping:
It’s possible Melissa simply closed the account for legitimate reasons (e.g., switching banks, consolidating accounts) and failed to maintain or provide records of her subsequent activity. While this might not be intentional concealment, it still constitutes a failure to meet disclosure requirements. Courts expect parties to provide complete records, and ignorance or negligence is not typically a valid defense.
Disregard for Disclosure Obligations:
By closing the account and not providing follow-up records, Melissa may appear to be disregarding her legal obligation to provide full financial transparency. This can erode trust in the divorce process and lead the other party to suspect misconduct, even if none exists. Courts may view this as a lack of good faith, potentially impacting rulings on asset division, alimony, or attorney fees.
Possible Legitimate Explanation:
Melissa might have transferred the $3,790.35 to another account (e.g., a new bank account, investment account) or used it for legitimate expenses (e.g., living costs, legal fees) after closing the Santander account. Without records, however, the other party and the court cannot verify this. If Melissa can provide documentation (e.g., statements from a new bank account showing the deposit of $3,790.35 and subsequent activity), this could mitigate concerns. However, the absence of such records in the current disclosure is problematic.
Impact on Financial Patterns:
The $3,790.35 withdrawal aligns with a pattern of significant cashouts in 2024, such as the $4,500.00 Venmo cashout on 08/14/24. This suggests Melissa may have been consolidating funds or preparing to close the account. However, the lack of follow-up records makes it impossible to determine whether these funds remained part of the marital estate or were used in a way that affects the divorce settlement.
Implications in Divorce Proceedings
Adverse Inference: Courts may draw an adverse inference from Melissa’s failure to disclose the $3,790.35 withdrawal and subsequent activity. This means they might assume the funds were hidden or misused, potentially impacting asset division or spousal support calculations in favor of the other party.
Sanctions or Penalties: If the other party files a motion to compel disclosure, Melissa could face sanctions, such as paying the other party’s legal fees, or be ordered to produce additional records. Non-compliance could also negatively affect her credibility in the case.
Asset Division: Without clarity on the $3,790.35, the court might impute this amount as an asset still

Below is a summary of all Zelle payments from Melissa A. Bemer to Stephen Boerner (including variations like Stephen Boern or Stephen Boer) from the comprehensive transaction table, which spans 12/21/21 to 09/30/24. The summary includes dates, totals, and key phases of life separated into three periods: **Pre-10/1/2023**, **10/1/2023–8/31/2024**, and **8/31/2024–Present**. Note that the latest date in the statements is 09/30/24, so the "Present" period will cover 8/31/2024 to 09/30/2024.

### Step 1: Extract Payments to Stephen Boerner
From the comprehensive table (98 transactions: 25 Zelle, 73 Venmo), I’ll extract all Zelle transactions where the recipient is Stephen Boerner, Stephen Boern, or Stephen Boer. As previously identified, there are 21 such transactions (including the 10/11/23 $163.50 payment to "Stephen St. Petersburg," confirmed as Stephen Boerner). One of these transactions, the $1,000.00 payment on 04/30/24, is a pass-through from Carol Boerner and will be excluded from the net total as it does not represent Melissa’s own funds.

Here are the relevant Zelle payments to Stephen Boerner:

  - 05/31/22: $1,200.00
  - 07/05/22: $1,200.00
  - 10/03/22: $1,200.00
  - 11/02/22: $1,200.00
  - 12/02/22: $1,200.00
  - 12/30/22: $1,200.00

  - 07/03/23: $1,400.00
  - 09/01/23: $2,500.00
- **Total**: $5.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,200.00 + $1,350.00 + $1,350.00 + $1,350.00 + $1,400.00 + $2,500.00 = **$18,555.00**
- **Context**:
  - **Address**: Philadelphia, PA (12/05/21–11/30/23).
  - **Phase of Life**: This period likely represents a stable phase in Philadelphia, with consistent monthly Zelle payments to Stephen Boerner, starting at $1,200.00 (May 2022), increasing to $1,350.00 (April 2023), and peaking at $2,500.00 (September 2023). The regularity suggests a financial arrangement, possibly support or debt repayment. Melissa’s Venmo activity during this time includes significant payments (e.g., $4,000.00 on 03/11/22, $1,500.00 on 07/28/23), indicating other large expenses or transfers.

#### Phase 2: 10/1/2023–8/31/2024
- **Dates Covered**: 10/01/23 to 08/31/24
- **Transactions**:
  - 10/11/23: $1,250.00
  - 10/11/23: $163.50
  - 11/03/23: $2,500.00
  - 04/25/24: $800.00
  - 04/30/24: $1,000.00 (Pass-through, excluded from net total)
  - 05/06/24: $800.00
  - 05/28/24: $800.00
  - 06/14/24: $1,000.00
- **Total (Excluding Pass-through)**: $1,250.00 + $163.50 + $2,500.00 + $800.00 + $800.00 + $800.00 + $1,000.00 = **$7,313.50**
- **Context**:
  - **Address**: Philadelphia, PA until 11/30/23, then Gulfport, FL (12/01/23–06/30/24), and Wayne, PA (07/01/24–08/31/24).
  - **Phase of Life**: This period shows a transition phase with multiple relocations, possibly reflecting a change in personal circumstances (e.g., job change, separation). The Zelle payments decrease in frequency (from monthly to sporadic) and amount (mostly $800.00–$1,250.00), suggesting a reduction in the financial arrangement with Stephen Boerner. The $2,500.00 payment on 11/03/23 is the last large payment, followed by smaller amounts. Venmo activity includes a significant $4,500.00 cashout on 08/14/24, indicating preparation for account closure.

#### Phase 3: 8/31/2024–Present (09/30/2024)
- **Dates Covered**: 08/31/24 to 09/30/24 (latest statement date; "Present" is 03/16/25, but no data exists beyond 09/30/24).
- **Transactions**: None.
- **Total**: $0.00
- **Context**:
  - **Address**: Wayne, PA (07/01/24–09/30/24).
  - **Phase of Life**: The account was closed on 09/25/24 with a $3,790.35 withdrawal, leaving a $0.00 balance by 09/30/24. No Zelle payments to Stephen Boerner occur in this period, and no further transactions are recorded, indicating Melissa likely moved her finances to another account. The closure suggests a significant life change, possibly finalizing financial arrangements or preparing for a new phase post-divorce.

### Step 3: Overall Totals and Key Insights
- **Total Payments to Stephen Boerner (Net)**:
  - Pre-10/1/2023: $18,555.00
  - 10/1/2023–8/31/2024: $7,313.50
  - 8/31/2024–Present: $0.00
  - **Grand Total (Excluding $1,000.00 Pass-through)**: $18,555.00 + $7,313.50 = **$25,868.50**
- **Key Insights**:
  - **Pre-10/1/2023**: High frequency and consistency in payments ($1,200.00–$2,500.00 monthly) suggest a structured financial obligation, possibly support or repayment, during a stable period in Philadelphia.
  - **10/1/2023–8/31/2024**: Reduced frequency and amounts ($800.00–$2,500.00, sporadic) align with relocations (Philadelphia to Gulfport to Wayne), indicating a transitional phase, possibly tied to separation or divorce proceedings.
  - **8/31/2024–Present**: No payments reflect the account closure on 09/25/24, suggesting Melissa ended this financial relationship or moved funds elsewhere, potentially post-divorce.

This summary provides a clear breakdown of payments to Stephen Boerner across the specified life phases, highlighting shifts in financial behavior and life circumstances.
