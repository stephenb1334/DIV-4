Strengthens argument of bad faith 

As a real estate attorney with dual specialization in divorce litigation, I’ll analyze your situation based on the By-laws of The Commons at New Street Condominium Owners Association (provided in the chunks) and Pennsylvania law, particularly the Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act (68 Pa. C.S. § 3101 et seq.), to address conflicts of interest and the obligations of your Realtor, who is also your neighbor, Vice President of the HOA Executive Board, and a member of the condominium association. Your residence at 246 N. 3rd St., Philadelphia, PA 19106, falls within the property governed by these bylaws (244-248 N. 3rd St. and 217-225 New St.), and your scenario spans your unit purchase in April 2022, separation in July 2024, and the current date of March 15, 2025.

Relevant Facts

	•	Ownership and Timeline: You and your wife purchased the unit in April 2022 while married. You separated in July 2024, and she filed for divorce that month. The unit remains unsold as of March 15, 2025 (234 days from July 22, 2024).
	•	Realtor’s Roles: Your Realtor, who was the seller’s agent in 2022 and your listing agent from July 22, 2024, lives in the same building, is a Unit Owner, and serves as Vice President of the Executive Board, recently elected to her third term.
	•	Financial Strain: Due to divorce-related financial difficulties, you and your wife have not paid HOA dues, leading to delinquency notices and threats of legal action from the HOA, where your Realtor serves as Vice President.
	•	Conflict Concern: You suspect a conflict of interest given her multiple roles—Realtor, neighbor, and HOA officer with access to your delinquent account information.

Analysis Based on the Bylaws

1. Conflict of Interest Provisions in the Bylaws

The bylaws explicitly address conflicts of interest involving Executive Board members in Article VIII: Contractual Powers:

	•	Section 8.1: Validity of Contracts with Interested Executive Board Members
	•	A contract or transaction between the Association and an Executive Board member (or an entity they’re affiliated with) is not voidable due to their interest if:
	•	The interest is disclosed or known to the Board, noted in minutes, and approved in good faith by a sufficient vote without counting the interested member’s vote.
	•	The transaction is made in good faith and not unconscionable to the Association.
	•	Application: This section applies to formal contracts (e.g., management agreements), not directly to your listing agreement with the Realtor as an individual. However, it establishes a framework for handling conflicts: disclosure, recusal from voting, and good faith action. There’s no evidence your Realtor disclosed her HOA role or your delinquency to you when entering the listing agreement, nor does this section mandate broader fiduciary duties beyond contracts.
	•	Section 8.2: Inclusion of Interested Executive Board Members in the Quorum
	•	Interested Board members can be counted for quorum purposes in such votes.
	•	Application: This reinforces that her presence on the Board doesn’t inherently invalidate actions, but it doesn’t address her duty to you as your Realtor.
	•	Absence of Broader Conflict Rules: The bylaws lack a general conflict-of-interest policy beyond contractual transactions. Typical Pennsylvania HOA bylaws might include broader provisions requiring officers to avoid conflicts in all dealings affecting Unit Owners (e.g., using confidential information), but these bylaws are silent on such obligations outside contracts.

2. Duties of the Vice President (Realtor’s HOA Role)

	•	Section 4.2(d): Vice-Presidents and Assistant Officers
	•	The Vice President performs the President’s duties in their absence, including implementing Board decisions, supervising Association affairs, and signing checks/documents as authorized.
	•	Application: As Vice President, your Realtor has access to financial records (e.g., delinquent dues) via the Treasurer’s duties (Section 4.2(c)), which include tracking assessments and unpaid amounts. The bylaws don’t prohibit her from using this information, but her dual role raises ethical questions under real estate and fiduciary law.

3. Delinquency and HOA Enforcement

	•	Section 6.2: Collection of Assessments
	•	Unpaid assessments over 30 days trigger “prompt action” by the Board or Managing Agent. Assessments unpaid after 5 days accrue 15% interest per annum (or another Board-set rate).
	•	Application: Your delinquency (ongoing since at least late 2024) justifies the HOA’s notices and legal threats. The Vice President, as a Board member, has a duty to enforce this, potentially conflicting with her duty to sell your unit.

4. Missing Provisions Compared to Typical PA HOA Bylaws

	•	Disclosure of Roles: Typical bylaws might require officers to disclose roles (e.g., Realtor status) to Unit Owners, especially in dealings affecting them. These bylaws don’t.
	•	Confidentiality: No provision restricts Board members from using Unit Owner financial data (e.g., delinquency) for personal gain or other purposes.
	•	Fiduciary Duty: While Section 5.1 grants the Board powers under the Act, it doesn’t explicitly impose a fiduciary duty to avoid conflicts beyond contracts, unlike some HOA bylaws that clarify duties of loyalty and care.

Pennsylvania Law and Realtor Obligations

Since the bylaws are governed by the Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act (68 Pa. C.S. § 3101 et seq.), additional legal standards apply:

	•	Section 3303(a): Fiduciary Duty of Board Members
	•	Executive Board members owe a fiduciary duty to the Association, acting in good faith and in its best interests. This doesn’t directly extend to individual Unit Owners but could conflict with her Realtor duty to you.
	•	Real Estate Licensing Law (63 P.S. § 455.101 et seq.):
	•	As your Realtor, she owes you a fiduciary duty (loyalty, disclosure, confidentiality, diligence) under Pennsylvania real estate law and the NAR Code of Ethics (if applicable). This includes:
	•	Disclosure: She should have disclosed her HOA role and potential access to your financial data before the listing agreement (July 22, 2024).
	•	Confidentiality: Using your delinquency status (known via her HOA role) against your sale could breach confidentiality.
	•	Loyalty: Her HOA duty to collect dues might incentivize delaying your sale to pressure payment, conflicting with her duty to market your unit effectively.

Legal Insights and Potential Claims

	1.	Conflict of Interest
	•	Bylaws Limitation: The bylaws’ conflict rules (Section 8.1) don’t cover this scenario (Realtor-client relationship vs. HOA role). Her failure to disclose her Vice President position when listing your unit likely breaches her Realtor fiduciary duty, not the bylaws directly.
	•	Actionable Issue: You could argue she exploited her HOA role (access to delinquency data) to your detriment, especially if she prioritized HOA interests (e.g., collection) over selling your unit.
	2.	Non-Performance as Realtor
	•	234 days without an offer suggests potential negligence or intentional delay. If she’s leveraging your financial strain (known via HOA) to benefit the Association or herself (e.g., buying the unit cheaply later), this breaches her Realtor duty of diligence and loyalty.
	•	Evidence Needed: Compare your listing price/marketing to similar units sold in the building since July 2024.
	3.	HOA Enforcement
	•	The HOA’s legal threats align with Section 6.2. Your divorce doesn’t excuse payment, but her dual role complicates fairness. If she influenced harsher enforcement due to your listing agreement, it’s a misuse of authority (though not explicitly barred by bylaws).
	4.	Divorce Litigation Angle
	•	Your wife co-owns the unit (assuming joint title from April 2022). Pennsylvania divorce law (23 Pa. C.S. § 3501) treats it as marital property, subject to equitable distribution. The Realtor’s actions affect this asset’s value, potentially impacting your settlement. Coordinate with your divorce attorney to address this.

Recommendations

	•	Demand Disclosure: Request proof she disclosed her HOA role before July 22, 2024. If absent, it strengthens a breach-of-duty claim.
	•	Terminate Listing: The 6-month agreement ended January 22, 2025 (180 days from July 22, 2024). You’re free to hire a new agent as of March 15, 2025, unless extended (check terms).
	•	File Complaints:
	•	PA Real Estate Commission: For fiduciary breach (non-disclosure, potential self-dealing).
	•	HOA Board: Cite her conduct as a conflict, though bylaws offer weak recourse.
	•	Legal Action: Consult your divorce attorney to sue the Realtor for breach of fiduciary duty, seeking damages (e.g., lost sale value, excess HOA fees). The bylaws’ silence on broader conflicts supports leaning on state law.
	•	Negotiate with HOA: Propose a payment plan, citing her dual role as a fairness issue, though Section 6.2 gives the Board leverage.

Conclusion

The bylaws address conflicts narrowly (Section 8.1), leaving gaps your Realtor’s actions exploit. Her obligations as Vice President (enforce dues) clash with her Realtor duty to you (sell efficiently), and her non-disclosure of roles is a red flag under Pennsylvania real estate law. You have a stronger case against her as a Realtor than via the HOA bylaws, bolstered by her access to your financial distress. Act swiftly—your divorce and sale timeline amplify the stakes.
